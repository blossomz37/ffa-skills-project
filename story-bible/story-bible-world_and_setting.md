## world_and_setting

**overview_setting_summary:**  
Maple Hollow sits in a sheltered Appalachian valley where mist clings to the trees and the moonlight lingers longer than it should. The town has always known its magic—werebears run the lumber mill, witches sell cider charms at the farmer’s market, and shifters patrol the woods during the full moon to keep balance between wild and human life. Every October, the Harvest Moon Festival celebrates that harmony with lantern parades, bonfires, and a midnight moon dance where humans and shifters move together in shared rhythm.  
Despite its supernatural roots, Maple Hollow remains a true small town—nosy, loyal, occasionally exasperating. Local gossip travels faster than the wind through autumn leaves. Everyone knows everyone, and no secret—magical or romantic—stays buried for long.

### sensory_landscape

* **sounds:** Laughter spilling from the cider barn; wolves howling from the ridge at dusk; fiddles and drums echoing through the festival grounds; wind rustling through drying cornstalks.  
* **scents:** Applewood smoke, pumpkin spice, damp leaves, cedar, fur and musk, maple syrup on pancakes, candle wax from the apothecary.  
* **sights:** Lantern-lit porches; carved pumpkins glowing with runes; the water tower crowned by a wolf-shaped weathervane; full moons mirrored in the lake; red-gold forests rolling into fog.  
* **textures:** Flannel and fur, cool night air, rough bark, soft fleece blankets, the smooth warmth of polished wood, the electric tingle before transformation.

### key_locations

* **harvest_square:** The heart of Maple Hollow. String lights, vendor booths, live music, and the annual Moonlight Parade take over the square every October. The café “Howl & Bean” anchors one corner—a favorite gossip spot.  
* **the_wildwood_tavern:** Shifter-owned bar and gathering space for all species. Known for its spiced whiskey, safe-shift rooms, and Friday night karaoke. It’s Caleb’s unofficial headquarters and second home.  
* **maple_ridge_cabin:** Caleb’s secluded family cabin overlooking the valley. A sanctuary of woodsmoke, worn quilts, and memories. Serves as the story’s emotional hearth and key setting for intimacy.  
* **the_old_observatory:** A hilltop ruin and local legend. Once used by shifters to track lunar cycles, now the scene of the first major romantic turning point.  
* **the_ink_and_ember_press:** The local print shop and newspaper office where Ethan works during his stay. Home to small-town politics, caffeine-fueled deadlines, and the first hints that the Harvest Moon might not be entirely safe this year.

### key_world_details

* **open_coexistence:** Humans, shifters, and minor magical beings coexist under long-standing peace accords signed in the 1920s. Children attend mixed schools; public spaces host both human and supernatural rituals.  
* **harvest_moon_legend:** Folklore says the Harvest Moon amplifies emotion—love, grief, rage—and that anyone denying their true nature risks losing control under its light.  
* **shifter_tradition:** Shifters shift communally under supervision and celebration. New pairs or “bonded hearts” are often revealed during this night, witnessed by the whole town.  
* **the_old_code:** A local bylaw known as the Hollow Accord governs disputes—no fighting within town limits, no transformation for intimidation, and all major conflicts must be settled through the council or ritual challenge.  
* **tourism:** In recent years, Maple Hollow has gained a gentle reputation as a “harvest haven,” attracting curious outsiders, bloggers, and journalists—like Ethan—who want a glimpse of “domesticated” magic.  
* **the_hidden_depths:** Beneath its charm, an old magic hums in the forest—older than shifters or humans. It surfaces only during rare lunar eclipses, when the town’s wards weaken.
