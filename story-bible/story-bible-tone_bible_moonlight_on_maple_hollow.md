### emotional_language_guide

#### core_emotions_to_highlight
1. **Yearning:** unspoken glances, hesitant touch, withheld words; often described through stillness and breath.  
2. **Comfort:** shared laughter, unguarded smiles, the quiet after tension resolves.  
3. **Awe:** moonlight, transformation, natural magic; wonder rendered through small details rather than exposition.  
4. **Fear:** not of violence, but of exposure; conveyed through micro-behaviors (averted eyes, laughter too quick).  
5. **Trust:** silence that feels safe; open body language, resting shoulders, shared tasks.  
6. **Joy:** laughter as intimacy; found family’s affection woven into sensory life—warm kitchens, soft teasing.

#### emotional_do’s_and_don’ts
* **do:** show emotion through environment (fog, light, sound).  
* **do:** pair emotional reveals with sensory action (a touch, a scent, a small smile).  
* **don’t:** narrate emotion abstractly (“he felt sad”)—translate into sensory moment (“he watched the steam fade before he spoke”).  
* **don’t:** let humor undercut sincerity—use wit as intimacy, not deflection (except early in Ethan’s arc).

### dialogue_and_voice_notes

#### ethan_voice
* **tone:** verbal, witty, self-aware, often ironic until emotion disarms him.  
* **rhythm:** quick sentences, observational humor; softens and lengthens when sincere.  
* **lexicon:** journalistic but warm — “maybe,” “apparently,” “truth be told,” “you’d think.”  
* **signature_emotional_shift:** humor → honesty → vulnerability; a visible softening in syntax and pace.  

#### caleb_voice
* **tone:** low, measured, calm; occasionally teasing with dry humor.  
* **rhythm:** slower sentences; emphasis on sensory verbs (feel, breathe, see, listen).  
* **lexicon:** grounded, tactile — “steady,” “warm,” “easy now,” “you’re safe.”  
* **signature_emotional_shift:** silence → confession → physical closeness; shows more through action than talk.  

#### banter_style
* Flirtation in understatement: shared jokes, callbacks, mock disagreements.  
* Humor arises from recognition and comfort, not humiliation or snark.  
* Example pattern:  
  - Ethan: “You’re really still using a flip phone?”  
  - Caleb: “It survives shifts and idiots. Present company excluded—barely.”  
  - Emotional follow-up: The laughter lingers long enough to turn into a shared look.

### intimacy_and_heat_language_reference

* **intimacy_tone:** Sensual, emotional, reverent. Heat should feel earned and grounded in tenderness.  
* **descriptive approach:** Focus on sensation and connection, not anatomy—heat through atmosphere.  
* **key sensory cues for intimacy:** breath, heartbeat, skin warmth, scent, touch contrast (calloused hand on soft skin), firelight.  
* **language cues for escalation:**  
  - *early:* “their laughter collided and stuck there”  
  - *mid:* “the air between them warmed until words felt unnecessary”  
  - *late:* “every movement said what they hadn’t dared to before.”  
* **afterglow:** Laughter, ease, playful teasing. Intimacy restores balance rather than depleting it.  
* **spice tone:** Explicit enough to satisfy a 4/5 rating; lyrical enough to preserve emotional continuity.

### emotional_and_sensory_equilibrium_rules
1. **Every emotional peak = sensory payoff.** If they confess, something in the environment changes (light, scent, sound).  
2. **Every sensory cue = emotional purpose.** No random detail—every smell, sound, or color should underline mood or character growth.  
3. **Touch carries truth.** Physical connection reveals what words withhold.  
4. **Silence is dialogue.** Stillness between lines holds emotional charge equal to speech.  
5. **Community as mirror.** The town’s reactions reflect the couple’s journey from secrecy to openness.
