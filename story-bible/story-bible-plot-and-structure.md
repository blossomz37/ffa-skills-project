### three_act_summary

* **act_1_setup (≈25%)**  
  Ethan returns to Maple Hollow to cover the annual Harvest Moon Festival—a fluffy local feature that’s meant to be an easy gig. He expects nostalgia and pumpkin pie, not Caleb Hawthorne: older, steadier, and more magnetic than ever.  
  The town’s supernatural integration fascinates Ethan professionally but unsettles him personally. Everyone insists the Harvest Moon is “different” this year—its pull stronger, emotions sharper.  
  When small acts of magical imbalance begin to ripple through town (candles flaring during arguments, objects shifting under moonlight), Ethan’s journalist instincts kick in.  
  *Emotional/Intimacy Phase:* **Reconnection through familiarity.** They tease, dance around old hurt, and rediscover friendship. Subtle physicality—shared glances, accidental brushes, playful banter—rekindles attraction.

  *Key Beats:*  
  - Return scene: Ethan arrives at the Gazette; Ruby ropes him into festival coverage.  
  - First meeting: Caleb fixing decorations; their reunion laced with humor and quiet heartbreak.  
  - Introduction of community stakes: Mayor Vance announces this year’s festival coincides with a rare lunar alignment.  
  - Catalyst: Ethan accepts an assignment to document “the Harvest Moon effect,” unknowingly making Caleb part of his story.

* **act_2_complication (≈50%)**  
  Ethan’s investigation reveals strange patterns: heightened emotions, stronger bonds, and sudden truth-telling among townsfolk. He suspects something beneath folklore—a residual magic triggered by emotional honesty. Caleb fears Ethan’s curiosity will expose rituals the town keeps sacred.  
  Forced to collaborate for the festival’s PR, they spend long nights revising speeches, handling town chaos, and trading warmth disguised as banter.  
  *Emotional/Intimacy Phase:* **Trust through vulnerability.** They share stories of what went wrong before: Caleb’s fear of failing as Alpha, Ethan’s grief and flight. The emotional intimacy becomes physical tension—lingering looks, laughter too soft, touches that last too long.  
  The “mystery” becomes symbolic: learning that the Harvest Moon magnifies whatever is unresolved—love or fear—and that only truth releases its hold.

  *Key Beats:*  
  - Town gossip scene at the Wildwood Tavern: teasing, warmth, and small emotional reveal.  
  - Observatory hike: subtle magic displays—glowing runes in moonlight; they nearly kiss.  
  - Midpoint Intimacy: a rainstorm forces them to shelter in the cabin. Emotional comfort turns to tender physicality—kisses, touches, whispered confessions, but restraint holds.  
  - Subplot payoff: Mara’s charm for “clarity” accidentally intensifies their attraction, symbolizing their need for honesty.

* **act_3_resolution (≈25%)**  
  The festival’s peak coincides with the full Harvest Moon. As emotions across town boil over, Ethan’s article drafts circulate accidentally, revealing vulnerable truths people weren’t ready to share—including Caleb’s confession about why he let Ethan go years ago.  
  Public tension threatens to divide the town, but Ethan refuses to let guilt or pride win again. He publicly apologizes and helps organize the Moonlight Parade, turning chaos into unity.  
  Caleb, moved, finally lets the Alpha façade drop; his shift under the moon becomes a gesture of trust, not dominance.  
  *Emotional/Intimacy Phase:* **Union through revelation.** They finally claim their love physically and emotionally—openly, joyfully, without restraint. The night ends in shared transformation and public acknowledgment of their bond.  

  *Key Beats:*  
  - Climax: the Moonlight Parade nearly derails from overcharged magic; Ethan steps in to calm the crowd, revealing truth about the Moon’s nature—honesty heals imbalance.  
  - Caleb’s confession: “I was never afraid of loving you. I was afraid of losing you twice.”  
  - Resolution: Caleb and Ethan’s union restores balance; the town celebrates them as the “bonded hearts” of this Harvest Moon.  
  - Epilogue: Life resumes—Ethan stays, runs a small local column, and Caleb bakes cinnamon rolls with Ruby and Mara’s supervision. Moonlight lingers on their shared porch, promising peace.
