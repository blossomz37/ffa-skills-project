### continuity_tracking_keys
1. **Ward ribbons** = emotional barometer of town; mention at least once per act.  
2. **Recorder / audio motif** = mirrors honesty theme; appears in Acts 1–2, retired after public confession.  
3. **Flannel shirt** = recurring tactile symbol of comfort; reappears in domestic finale.  
4. **Lantern flare motif** = signals emotional peaks (Ch 3, 5, 12).  
5. **Coffee / morning scenes** = reset tone after tension; used in Ch 7 & 13 intentionally.

### line-level style reminders
* Favor **present sensory detail** over exposition (“The wood hummed with warmth beneath his palms.”).  
* Let **banter evolve** from defense → play → affection.  
* Use **pause beats** instead of long internal paragraphs; silence carries weight.  
* **End chapters on sensory hooks**—light change, breath, or touch.  
* Each emotional revelation should shift the environment in a small, visible way (fog lifts, lantern steadies, fire crackles).

### drafting checklist
Before writing each scene:  
1. Re-read tone bible paragraph on sensory language.  
2. Choose **one dominant sense** (sound, scent, touch) to highlight.  
3. Confirm the **emotional target** from this chart.  
4. Introduce or echo the **appropriate motif** (fog, light, water, etc.).  
5. End with **image or physical cue**, not abstract thought.

### closing_statement
Every chapter of *Moonlight on Maple Hollow* should feel like a shift in weather—subtle, sensual, truthful.  Each sensory detail is an act of honesty; each laugh or touch, a small promise that warmth always returns after fog.
