## author_voice_and_writing_style

### reader_experience_goal
* **reader_experience_goal:** Readers should feel wrapped in warmth and yearning—like sitting by a bonfire under a harvest moon. Each page should offer slow-blooming tension, deep emotional resonance, and a sense that love itself is part of the town’s quiet magic.

### core_prose_style_directives
* **pacing_and_rhythm:** Moderate and rhythmic; prose alternates between sensory stillness and bursts of emotional electricity. Use shorter sentences during tension or intimacy; linger on description during quiet, reflective beats.  
* **level_of_detail:** Lush and immersive. Details should evoke the scent of wet leaves, the feel of worn wood, and the glow of firelight. Avoid over-describing—each sensory note should deepen mood or emotion.  
* **action_vs_introspection:** 60% dialogue/action, 40% internal reflection. Focus on what characters *do* with their feelings—touch, retreat, confess, resist—rather than long interior monologues.  
* **language_formality:** Semi-lyrical and modern. Emotional directness over florid description; metaphors drawn from nature, moonlight, and memory.  
* **show_don’t_tell:** Use gesture, breath, and setting as emotional language. Show longing through distance, care through touch, and truth through restraint.  
* **diversify_vocabulary_and_avoid_predictable_phrasing:** Use rich but natural vocabulary rooted in sensory experience (e.g., “the air hummed with quiet promise,” rather than “he felt something in the air”). Avoid clichés and overwrought paranormal tropes.

### core_voice_and_emotion
* **voice_authenticity_directive:** All imagery and tone should reflect the POV character’s internal compass—Ethan’s observational curiosity and Caleb’s grounded patience. Metaphors and observations emerge from their personal experiences rather than omniscient narration.  
* **emotion_rendering:** Emotional beats unfold through: (1) dialogue laced with restraint, (2) tactile and sensory triggers (the smell of smoke, warmth of breath), (3) environmental echoes (wind shifting through trees mirroring hesitation), and (4) visceral, bodily reactions (shiver, pulse, stillness).  
* **banned_tropes_and_phrases:**  
  - “He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.”  
  - “Shivers down his spine.”  
  - “Fate had other plans.”  
  - “Their lips crashed together.”  
  - “Alpha growl cliché” (replace with subtler cues of dominance/affection).

### pacing_and_scene_dynamics
* **the_opening_rule:** Begin scenes with immediate relevance—a moment of tension, humor, or atmosphere. Avoid static exposition. Introduce emotional tone through sensory cues (e.g., fog curling around the diner’s neon sign as Ethan walks in).  
* **the_closing_rule:** End scenes on quiet hooks or intimate beats—an unfinished question, a near-touch, a withheld truth.  
* **single_pov_per_scene:** Strict alternation between Ethan and Caleb. Each scene closes with an internal pulse or image unique to their emotional filter.  
* **scene_momentum_priority:** Start mid-conversation or in the midst of discovery. Use dialogue and motion to reveal character. Physicality (making tea, mending, walking, cooking) anchors emotional subtext.  
* **the_momentum_rule:** Every scene must move both the emotional and romantic threads forward. Even quiet moments—sitting on a porch, watching fog roll in—should carry emotional consequence or reveal internal change.

### tonal_signature
* **voice_palette:** Autumnal, intimate, wistful. A balance of human tenderness and quiet magic.  
* **comparative_examples:**  
  - *TJ Klune’s* “Green Creek” series (for emotional sincerity)  
  - *KJ Charles*’ “Charm of Magpies” tone (for grounded sensuality)  
  - *Olivia Dade*’s warmth and pacing (for relational realism)
