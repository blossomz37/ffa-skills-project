### main_character_1
@Ethan 

#### basic_information
* **full_name:** Ethan Cole  
* **nicknames_terms_of_endearment:** “City Boy,” “Scoop,” occasionally “Moonbrain” (teasingly, from the pack).  
* **age:** 30  
* **profession_or_role:** Investigative journalist temporarily working for the Maple Hollow Gazette.  
* **personality_traits:** Curious, witty, emotionally cautious, skeptical, deeply loyal once trust is earned, hides vulnerability behind humor.  
* **physical_description:** Lean, sharp-featured, dark curls often wind-tousled; usually seen in layered flannels and worn leather boots. Hazel eyes with a permanent undercurrent of fatigue and wonder.  
* **backstory_essentials:** Left Maple Hollow at eighteen after his father’s death and a painful falling-out with Caleb. Built a career exposing corruption, but burnout and loneliness drive him home for a “simple” assignment that turns personal fast.

#### motivation_and_wounds
* **primary_motivation:** Prove to himself he can tell the truth without getting hurt—professionally or emotionally.  
* **core_wound:** Losing both his father and first love in the same season made him equate intimacy with loss.  
* **central_flaw:** Avoids emotional vulnerability by intellectualizing everything.  
* **internal_conflict:** Torn between longing for connection and fear of being consumed by it.  
* **internal_goal:** To feel like he belongs somewhere again, beyond headlines and deadlines.  
* **external_personal_goal:** Finish his feature on the Harvest Moon Festival without reopening old wounds—an impossible task once Caleb reappears.

#### character_story_arc
* **starting_state:** Detached, skeptical, pretending to be unaffected by the supernatural community he grew up in.  
* **growth_change_process:** Learns that truth doesn’t have to wound, and that love isn’t exposure—it’s choice.  
* **ending_state:** Opens himself to community and intimacy, finding both love and peace under the same moon that once drove him away.
