### main_character_2
@Caleb
#### basic_information
* **full_name:** Caleb Hawthorne  
* **nicknames_terms_of_endearment:** “Alpha,” “Cal,” “Moonrise” (used only by Ethan in later chapters).  
* **age:** 32  
* **profession_or_role:** Alpha of the Maple Hollow shifter pack and owner of the Wildwood Tavern.  
* **personality_traits:** Steady, quietly charismatic, protective, patient, slightly broody but with dry humor; carries the weight of leadership with grace.  
* **physical_description:** Tall, broad-shouldered, tawny hair usually tied back; deep green eyes that reflect gold in moonlight; wears flannel and jeans with a constant air of grounded calm.  
* **backstory_essentials:** Inherited leadership early after his father’s passing. When Ethan left, Caleb chose duty over love, believing his pack needed him more. Years later, he’s respected but lonely, defined by responsibility rather than choice.

#### motivation_and_wounds
* **primary_motivation:** Keep Maple Hollow stable and safe during the Harvest Moon, especially as tensions rise between newcomers and old pack traditions.  
* **core_wound:** Believes love and leadership can’t coexist—he already “failed” Ethan once.  
* **central_flaw:** Self-sacrificing to a fault; assumes control of everyone’s burdens but his own.  
* **internal_conflict:** Desires intimacy yet fears it will compromise his control and endanger his people.  
* **internal_goal:** To be seen and loved not as an Alpha, but simply as Caleb.  
* **external_personal_goal:** Maintain peace through the festival while hiding the strain of the Harvest Moon’s unpredictable effects on him.

#### character_story_arc
* **starting_state:** Respected but emotionally isolated; believes duty must come before everything.  
* **growth_change_process:** Learns that true strength lies in vulnerability and shared leadership.  
* **ending_state:** Redefines what it means to protect—by allowing others, including Ethan, to love and carry him in return.
