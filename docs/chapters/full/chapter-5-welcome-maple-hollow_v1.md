# Chapter 5 – Welcome, Maple Hollow

Ethan's breath fogged the edge of the mic, ghosting his first word across a hundred listening faces.

He stood on the makeshift stage in Harvest Square—really just a platform of reinforced plywood that the town erected every year, but sturdy enough to hold two people, a mic stand, and the weight of a hundred expectations. The October afternoon had deepened into early evening, the sky that particular shade of blue that came just before true darkness. Lanterns hung from every available surface, not yet lit but waiting, their glass catching the last of the daylight like promises.

The square had transformed overnight. Bunting in autumn colors—rust and gold and deep burgundy—draped between lamp posts and storefronts. Vendor booths lined the perimeter, offering everything from spiced cider to hand-carved walking sticks to Mara's notorious "Moonlight Tinctures" (which were probably seventy percent placebo and thirty percent actual magic, though Ethan had never been brave enough to verify). The smell of roasting chestnuts competed with woodsmoke and the particular sweetness of maple-glazed donuts from the bakery cart.

People filled every available space—locals who'd seen this ceremony a dozen times but came anyway because that's what you did in Maple Hollow, and tourists who'd driven hours for a taste of authentic small-town magic. Children darted between adults' legs, hopped up on sugar and the promise of staying up past bedtime. Someone had released a handful of monarch butterflies near the gazebo, and they drifted through the crowd like animated autumn leaves.

It was picturesque. It was quintessentially Maple Hollow. It was exactly the kind of scene that Ethan's editor would eat up for the feature piece.

It was also completely terrifying.

"You're fidgeting," Ruby said from her position stage-left, where she was ostensibly managing sound but actually seemed to be documenting every moment with her phone. "Stop fidgeting."

"I'm not fidgeting."

"Your left hand has been in and out of your pocket four times in the last minute. That's fidgeting." She grinned. "Nervous about something? Or someone?"

Ethan ignored that. He was a professional. He'd interviewed corrupt politicians, exposed corporate fraud, stood his ground against PR teams with budgets bigger than small countries. He could handle co-hosting a small-town welcome ceremony.

Even if said co-hosting required standing approximately two feet away from Caleb Hawthorne for fifteen minutes.

Even if he'd barely slept last night replaying their conversation at the square, analyzing every word and expression for hidden meaning like he was decoding classified documents.

Even if his hands had been shaking since he'd arrived at the square an hour ago for tech check.

Professional. He was a professional.

Ruby crossed the stage to him, making a show of adjusting his collar even though it was perfectly fine. "Breathe," she said quietly, the teasing gone from her voice. "You've got this. And if you don't, you've got me on the sound board, and I will absolutely play an airhorn to cover any awkward silences."

"That's not reassuring."

"It wasn't meant to be." She stepped back, examining him critically. "Although you do look good. Very 'local boy returns home to discover his roots' chic."

Ethan glanced down at himself. He'd agonized over what to wear for approximately thirty seconds before defaulting to his usual—dark jeans, a flannel shirt in deep green, his leather jacket because the evening air was cold enough to justify it. Practical. Unremarkable. Definitely not an outfit that required thirty minutes of consideration and two complete changes.

"I look like I always look," he said.

"Exactly." Ruby's smile was knowing. "Very hometown hero. Very 'I never really left.' It's perfect."

Before Ethan could formulate a response that didn't involve admitting that yes, okay, he'd maybe thought about whether Caleb would notice what he was wearing, movement near the stage steps caught his attention.

Caleb climbed onto the platform with the easy confidence of someone who did this every year, who knew exactly where to step to avoid the slightly loose board near the back corner, who belonged here in a way Ethan wasn't sure he ever had. He wore dark slacks and a sweater the color of charcoal, simple and elegant and completely unfair. His hair looked like he'd run his hands through it recently—probably multiple times, if Ethan knew him at all, which apparently he still did despite twelve years of distance.

Their eyes met. Held.

Something in Ethan's chest did a complicated maneuver that wasn't quite a skip and wasn't quite a squeeze but involved forgetting how breath worked.

"Hey," Caleb said, and just like that the noise of the crowd seemed to dim slightly, the chaos narrowing to just the two of them standing on a plywood stage while the whole town watched.

"Hey yourself." Ethan was proud of how normal his voice sounded. "Ready for this?"

"I've been doing this for eight years. Question is—" Caleb's mouth quirked in something that might have been a smile if it had committed fully, "—are you?"

"I've interviewed senators who were actively lying to my face. I think I can handle reading some welcome copy to a friendly crowd."

"Senators don't know you like these people do."

The observation landed with more weight than it should have. Because Caleb was right—half the people in this square had known Ethan since he was a kid. Had watched him grow up, had been at his father's funeral, had probably gossiped about his and Caleb's relationship with the same invested interest they now brought to the festival lineup.

There was nowhere to hide here. No professional distance to maintain when everyone already knew the story.

"Comforting," Ethan said dryly.

Caleb's almost-smile became slightly more committed. "If it helps, they're rooting for this to go well. For both of us."

"Is that your professional Alpha assessment, or just your personal opinion?"

"Yes."

The response was so perfectly Caleb—deadpan, economical, landing right in the space between serious and teasing—that Ethan felt something loosen in his chest. Maybe this would be okay. Maybe they could do this without it being weird or painful or complicated.

Mayor Vance's voice boomed across the square from the base of the stage, amplified by what had to be Ruby's doing. "Ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished creatures of all persuasions—welcome to the fifteenth annual Harvest Moon Festival!"

The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Someone howled—whether wolf or enthusiastic human, Ethan couldn't tell. The Hollow Choir, positioned near the gazebo in their matching burgundy robes, answered with a rising note that made the hair on Ethan's arms stand up. Not in fear, exactly, but in recognition of something older than words, something that lived in harmony and moonlight.

"That's our cue," Caleb said, and gestured toward the mic stand positioned center-stage.

Right. The ceremony. The job. The reason they were both standing here pretending their entire history wasn't humming in the two feet of space between them.

Ethan moved to the mic, Caleb falling into position beside him. Close enough that Ethan could smell him—pine and woodsmoke and something warmer, more personal, that his body recognized before his brain could name it. Close enough that when Caleb shifted slightly, their shoulders almost touched.

The mic stand was positioned so they'd have to share it, leaning in at angles to speak. Intimate by necessity, probably intentional by design. Mayor Vance had a reputation for romantic meddling, and this setup had her fingerprints all over it.

Too late to do anything about it now.

Mayor Vance climbed onto the stage, resplendent in a velvet jacket that had probably been festive in 1987 and had somehow circled back to charming. She spread her arms wide, her smile radiant. "My dear friends, what a gift it is to stand here once again under the waxing moon, in the company of those we love and those we're about to love. We gather here, as we do every year, to honor the turning of seasons, the magic in the mundane, and the truth that the best stories are the ones we live together."

The crowd was rapt. Vance had that effect—part grandmother, part sage, entirely magnetic.

"This year," she continued, "we're blessed with a special collaboration. Our own Alpha, Caleb Hawthorne, who needs no introduction—" Caleb received a round of applause that he acknowledged with a slight nod, "—and Ethan Cole, who left us for the bright lights of journalism but has returned to remind us why this town is worth writing about."

More applause. Warmer than Ethan expected, edged with what felt like genuine welcome. Several people near the front were grinning at him with the particular fondness reserved for kids who'd moved away and come home. Mrs. Chen from the bookstore gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up.

Ethan's throat felt suddenly tight.

"They'll be guiding us through the week ahead," Vance said, "sharing stories, hosting events, and generally making sure you all find your way to the good pie before the tourists eat it all." Laughter rippled through the crowd. "So without further ado—Caleb, Ethan, the stage is yours."

She swept off the platform with theatrical grace, leaving them alone at the mic.

For a beat, neither of them moved. The crowd waited, expectant and indulgent. Somewhere in the back, Mara rang a small bell—probably some witchy blessing thing, or possibly just Mara being Mara.

Caleb leaned toward the mic, his voice dropping into that low register that carried authority without force. "Welcome home," he said simply. "All of you—those who've been here since birth, and those who just arrived today. This is Maple Hollow. We're glad you're here."

The simplicity of it, the sincerity, settled over the crowd like a benediction.

Ethan leaned in from the other side, close enough that he could feel Caleb's warmth, could sense the steady presence of him. "If you're new to Maple Hollow," he said, letting his journalist's training keep his voice clear and engaging, "you should know a few things. First, we measure time in cinnamon and moonlight." A few chuckles from the audience. "Second, the maple coffee at Ruby's café is legally classified as a controlled substance in three states, but we promise it's worth the risk."

Ruby's voice carried from stage-left: "That's slander!"

"That's advertising," Ethan countered, and got a bigger laugh. He was settling into it now, the familiar rhythm of performance, the way crowds responded to confidence even when you were faking it. "And third—most importantly—we don't let anyone celebrate alone. If you're here, you're part of this. So get ready to dance badly, eat too much pie, and possibly cry during the Hollow Choir's performance on Saturday night. They're devastatingly talented and they know it."

The Choir responded with a pleased harmonic hum that made the lanterns overhead shiver slightly.

Caleb picked up the thread seamlessly. "The festival officially runs through Sunday night, but the real celebration is whenever two or more people decide to make something beautiful together. That could be a shared meal, a conversation, a dance, a song—whatever feeds your spirit." He paused, and something in his voice softened. "That's what this town does best. We remember how to be human together."

Ethan's chest did that complicated thing again. Because that was so perfectly Caleb—earnest and grounded and completely without irony. Saying things that should sound cheesy but somehow landed like truth.

They had a script, sort of. Mayor Vance had provided an outline with key points to hit, transitions to make, logistics to cover. But they were already deviating from it, finding their own rhythm the way they used to during their old late-night conversations, when they'd trade observations and build on each other's thoughts until they'd talked themselves into dawn.

"Schedule-wise," Ethan said, pulling himself back to task, "we've got events running from sunrise to well past moonrise. There's a full lineup in your program—Ruby's handing those out, they're the papers that are definitely not propaganda."

"They're extremely propaganda," Ruby called out cheerfully.

"Tomorrow morning at eight," Caleb continued, "we've got the Artisan Market opening in the square. Local crafts, some of which are actually practical and some of which are extremely magical and probably shouldn't be operated without supervision."

"That's Mara's booth," Ethan clarified.

"That's Mara's entire business model," Caleb agreed, and got appreciative laughter from people who knew exactly what he meant.

They went through the highlights—the pie competition on Wednesday, the storytelling circle on Thursday, the moonlight run on Friday for pack members and sanctioned guests. The information was straightforward, but the delivery wasn't. They fell into an easy banter, trading lines and building off each other's energy. When Ethan stumbled slightly over the pronunciation of one of the folk band names, Caleb caught it with a gentle correction that felt more like collaboration than criticism. When Caleb's delivery got a little too formal, Ethan threw in a joke that landed perfectly and reminded everyone this was supposed to be fun.

It was, Ethan realized with something close to wonder, actually working.

The crowd was with them, laughing in the right places, engaged and warm. Ruby was documenting it all with her phone and what looked like a very professional audio recorder. Mayor Vance watched from the base of the stage with the satisfied expression of someone whose plan was coming together exactly as she'd hoped.

And Caleb—

Caleb was looking at him with an expression Ethan couldn't quite name. Not quite a smile, but close. Something warmer than professional courtesy, softer than the careful distance they'd been maintaining since Ethan arrived in town. Something that made Ethan acutely aware of how close they were standing, how natural this felt, how easy it would be to let himself want this beyond the bounds of a single ceremony.

Dangerous territory. Ethan pulled his focus back to the script.

"Saturday night," he said, "we have the main event—the Harvest Moon Celebration. Music, dancing, more pie than any town should legally possess, and the Hollow Choir performing their annual concert under the full moon."

"It's worth staying up for," Caleb added. "Trust me on that."

"And Sunday morning," Ethan continued, "we close with the Gratitude Gathering—a potluck breakfast where everyone shares something they're thankful for. It's sentimental and probably overlong and absolutely mandatory."

"Very mandatory," Caleb confirmed. "We take gratitude seriously here."

They'd reached the end of the scripted material. According to Vance's outline, this was where they were supposed to hand back to her for the official lighting of the lanterns and the opening of the food booths.

Instead, Ethan found himself saying: "Before we go, though, I want to say something off-script."

Beside him, Caleb went very still. Ruby looked up sharply from her phone. The crowd quieted, sensing a shift in tone.

Ethan hadn't planned this. Hadn't even known he was going to say it until the words were already forming. But now that they'd started, he couldn't stop them.

"I left Maple Hollow twelve years ago," he said, his voice carrying across the now-silent square. "I left for a lot of reasons—some good, some less good, most of them complicated in the way that things are when you're young and grieving and don't know how to ask for what you need." He could feel Caleb's attention on him, heavy and focused. "I've spent those twelve years telling other people's stories. Documenting their truths, exposing their lies, trying to make sense of a world that often doesn't make sense."

The crowd was so quiet he could hear the breeze rustling through the bunting overhead.

"But coming back here," Ethan continued, and his voice caught slightly before he recovered, "I'm remembering that some truths don't need exposition. Some stories tell themselves just by existing in proximity to the people who matter." He turned slightly, just enough to meet Caleb's eyes. "So—thank you. For letting me be part of this. For making it easy when it could have been hard. For reminding me that home isn't just a place you leave—it's a place that holds space for you coming back."

The silence held for another beat. Then someone in the crowd started clapping. Then someone else. Then the whole square erupted in applause, warm and genuine and edged with the particular emotion that came from a community witnessing someone's homecoming.

Ethan's face felt hot. This was not professional. This was definitely not maintaining appropriate journalistic distance.

But Caleb was smiling—actually smiling, full and genuine—and that made everything else feel secondary.

"Well," Caleb said, his voice pitched just loud enough for Ethan to hear under the applause, "that wasn't in the script."

"Sorry. Journalist brain. Sometimes I have opinions."

"Don't apologize." Caleb's expression was warm, open in a way that made Ethan's breath catch. "It was good. Real."

Before Ethan could respond, Mayor Vance reclaimed the stage, her eyes suspiciously bright. "Well then," she said, her voice thick with satisfaction. "I think that settles it. To honesty, harmony, and good pie—preferably in that order. Let's light this festival up!"

She produced what looked like a single wooden match from her pocket—definitely ceremonial, probably magical, absolutely Vance's style—and struck it against the stage railing. The flame caught, bright and steady.

"In the name of harvest and homecoming," she called out, "let the light lead us forward!"

She touched the match to a lantern at the corner of the stage. The flame inside caught immediately, glowing warm and golden. And then—as if responding to some signal Ethan couldn't hear—every lantern in the square flickered to life simultaneously. Hundreds of them, strung between buildings and hung from posts and dotting the vendor booths, all glowing with warm, honey-colored light.

The crowd gasped collectively. Then cheered.

The Hollow Choir launched into a rising harmony—wordless but full of joy, the kind of sound that lived somewhere between human and something older. The food vendors opened their booths. Someone started playing fiddle music from the direction of the gazebo. Children ran toward the game booths with their parents calling halfhearted warnings after them.

The festival had officially begun.

"Come on," Ruby said, appearing at the stage steps with her phone and recorder. "Off the stage before you two get trampled by the cider line."

Ethan descended the steps carefully, his legs slightly unsteady in a way that had nothing to do with the platform's construction. Caleb followed, close enough that Ethan could feel his presence like heat at his back.

They reached the ground and stepped away from the immediate press of the crowd, finding a small pocket of relative quiet near the corner of the bookstore. Ruby had disappeared into the chaos, probably already interviewing someone for her podcast.

"So," Caleb said.

"So," Ethan echoed.

They stood there for a moment, the festival swirling around them but not quite touching them. The lantern light painted everything in shades of gold and amber. The smell of cinnamon and woodsmoke and possibility hung thick in the cold air.

"You did good up there," Caleb said finally.

"We did good," Ethan corrected. "It was—" He searched for the right word. "—easy. Easier than I thought it would be."

"Yeah." Caleb's expression was thoughtful, his eyes reflecting the lantern light in a way that made them look warmer, softer. "It was."

There was something in the way he said it—not quite a question, not quite a statement. An opening, maybe. An acknowledgment that "easy" might mean more than just successful public speaking.

Ethan's hands were back in his pockets, his default defensive position. He pulled them out consciously, made himself stand there without armor.

"The thing I said," he started. "About coming home. I meant it."

"I know." Caleb's voice was quiet enough that Ethan had to lean slightly closer to hear it over the festival noise. "I'm glad you're here."

The simplicity of it—no qualification, no caveat, just straightforward sincerity—made Ethan's throat tight again.

Before he could figure out how to respond, a child barreled between them, chasing another child who was waving what looked like a wooden sword and possibly casting minor hexes. Their mother followed at a more sedate pace, calling apologies.

The moment broke. Reality reasserted itself.

"I should—" Ethan gestured vaguely toward the crowd. "Journalist things. Interviews, observations, pretending I'm here professionally."

"Right." Caleb's smile was back, but more contained now. "And I've got—Alpha things. People to greet, boundaries to maintain, pie to judge."

"You're judging the pie competition?"

"I'm eating samples before the pie competition. Different thing entirely."

Ethan laughed despite himself. "That's abuse of power."

"That's excellent delegation of responsibility."

They were bantering again, falling into familiar rhythms like no time had passed. Like they hadn't spent twelve years apart. Like standing this close to each other in lantern light while the whole town celebrated around them was perfectly normal and not at all complicated.

"Tomorrow?" Caleb said. "That coffee I owe you? For saving the intro."

"You saved the intro."

"We're going to disagree on that. Coffee anyway?"

Ethan should say no. Should maintain some professional boundary, some emotional distance. Should remember that this was temporary, that he'd be leaving again in a few weeks, that falling back into orbit around Caleb Hawthorne was exactly the complication he'd promised himself he wouldn't allow.

"Yeah," he heard himself say. "Coffee sounds good."

Caleb's smile was small but genuine. "Ruby's place. Nine tomorrow?"

"I'll be there."

They stood there for another beat, neither quite ready to leave. The festival continued around them, joyful and chaotic and completely oblivious to the fact that something had just shifted between them—something small but significant, like the first crack in ice before the thaw.

Above them, one of the lanterns flared suddenly brighter—its filament glowing sharp and golden for a long moment before settling back to normal warmth.

Both of them looked up at it, then at each other.

"That's not—" Ethan started.

"Normal? No." Caleb was still looking at the lantern, his expression caught between amused and considering. "But then, nothing about this week is going to be normal."

The lantern continued glowing steady and warm, as if satisfied with whatever point it had just made.

Ethan couldn't argue with that.

"See you tomorrow," he said.

"Tomorrow," Caleb confirmed.

They separated then, Caleb moving back into the crowd to fulfill his Alpha responsibilities, Ethan pulling out his recorder to do the journalist work he'd been sent here to do. But as Ethan wove through the festival-goers, documenting their joy and their magic and their uncomplicated celebration of community, he couldn't stop replaying the last hour.

The way it had felt standing next to Caleb on that stage. The way their banter had flowed like muscle memory. The way Caleb had looked at him when Ethan had gone off-script—surprised but not displeased, warm but not pitying.

The way the whole town had erupted in applause like they'd been waiting twelve years for Ethan to say out loud what everyone already knew: that leaving hadn't meant stopping to care.

Ruby found him near the cider stand, her phone already filling with footage. "That," she said, grinning, "was exactly as good as I'd hoped it would be."

"It was fine."

"It was extremely not fine. It was two people who are clearly still—" She made a complicated gesture that somehow conveyed everything she wasn't saying out loud. "—doing a terrible job of pretending they don't feel things."

"I'm here to work."

"You're here to come home," Ruby corrected. "The work is just your excuse. But hey, I'll allow it." She bumped her shoulder against his. "For the record? I'm proud of you. That thing you said at the end? That was brave."

"That was impulsive and probably inappropriate."

"That was honest. There's a difference."

Ethan didn't have a response to that. Or rather, he had too many responses, all of them complicated and several of them involving admitting things he wasn't ready to admit.

So instead he said: "Show me what you got on the recorder. I need B-roll for the article."

Ruby rolled her eyes but pulled up her phone, and they spent the next twenty minutes reviewing footage while the festival continued around them—bright and warm and full of the kind of magic that had nothing to do with supernatural abilities and everything to do with people choosing to celebrate together.

Later, walking back to Aunt Sophie's house through streets still glowing with lantern light, Ethan couldn't shake the feeling that something had begun tonight. Not just the festival, though that too. Something more personal. More inevitable.

Like the town itself had decided that twelve years was long enough for grief, long enough for distance, long enough for pretending that some things could be left behind instead of carried forward.

The lantern had flared. The crowd had cheered. Caleb had smiled.

And Ethan, despite every rational reason not to, was starting to let himself hope.
