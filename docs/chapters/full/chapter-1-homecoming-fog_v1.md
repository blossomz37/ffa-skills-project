Mist swallowed the last road sign before Maple Hollow—appropriate, Ethan thought, for a place that preferred its secrets blurred.

The GPS had stopped working twenty miles ago. Not that he needed it. His hands remembered the turns, his body remembered the road—remembered it in a way that went deeper than conscious geography. The cellular signal had faded too, dropping him back into the analog world of his childhood, where the forest was the only network that mattered.

He'd been driving through this particular wilderness for almost an hour, and it had taken him gradually backward through time.

First came the fire tower—the old wooden structure he'd climbed with friends on stupid dares, rising skeletal from the ridge line above the creek. Ethan recognized it from a distance, a landmark his memory had preserved perfectly. Beyond it, toward the east, he knew the tower keeper's cottage still stood, though he couldn't see it through the thickening trees. Old Miguel had died in '09. Someone else lived there now, probably. Someone who didn't know the stories.

The Creek Bridge was next—the single-lane wooden crossing that always made his stomach lurch as a kid. His Subaru rattled across it now, tires humming on weathered boards. Ethan had kissed someone under this bridge once, pressed against the north rail as the creek sang below them. They'd been seventeen, and reckless, and he'd tasted like whiskey and wanting to stay, even though staying had never been an option.

He didn't think about that too hard.

Past the bridge, the road curved sharp enough to require downshifting, and the forest closed in properly—old growth that had been there before any of them, that would be there long after. The trees arched differently here, bending toward each other like old friends sharing whispers, creating a canopy dense enough to turn afternoon into perpetual twilight. Ethan's shoulders loosened a fraction at the shade. He'd forgotten what it felt like to be held by a forest this old, this patient.

The sun spilled through in scattered gold, creating pools of light that broke and reformed with each curve of the road. Maple leaves—the real ones, not the stylized versions on every local business's logo—drifted down in lazy spirals. The air was changing. Not just the season shifting but something deeper, something that made his wolf twitch against the inside of his skin.

Twelve years. Twelve years since he'd fled this valley with its too-sharp memories and suffocating kindness. And what was his brilliant plan now? Come back, write a fluffy piece about quirky small-town festivities, and leave without disturbing the silt of old heartbreak. Easy. Professional. Brief.

His phone buzzed to life as the GPS finally acquired a signal again. *You have arrived at your destination!* the cheerful voice announced, as if arrival meant anything when the real destination was something he couldn't drive toward, couldn't navigate, couldn't even name.

Ethan took the final curve deliberately slowly. The tension along his shoulders had been climbing for the last hour, tightening with each mile. His hands gripped the wheel too hard. His chest had begun that familiar compression—the one that came before panic, before choice, before facing things that didn't want to be faced.

The Howl & Bean Café came into view as he rounded the bend, its wide porch adorned with flickering jack-o'-lanterns despite the early hour. A string of copper lanterns hung beneath the eaves, unlit but waiting for dusk. The parking lot held only three cars—quiet for a Wednesday, unless Maple Hollow had changed more than he expected.

Ethan pulled in slowly, the gravel crunching under his tires with a sound that carried him back to teenage years—sneaking out, coming home late, parking in just this spot to gather courage before facing his father. He killed the engine and sat in the sudden silence, hands still on the wheel.

The café's wide porch looked welcoming in that aggressive way small towns perfected. Through the windows, he caught glimpses of customers—locals with the particular comfort of people who knew exactly where they belonged. Someone at a corner table was reading; someone else was typing on a laptop. The space had the hushed energy of afternoon lull, not yet waking into evening.

He couldn't bring himself to move.

Instead, Ethan reached for his digital recorder from the passenger seat, fiddling with it as he cataloged details through the windshield. The café's new forest-green paint was crisp, professional. The "HARVEST MOON SPECIAL: PUMPKIN SPICE MAPLE LATTE" sign was rendered in careful chalk lettering, the kind someone had spent an hour perfecting. And there, barely visible unless you knew to look for it, the carved runes etched subtly into the doorframe—protection wards that most tourists would mistake for decorative flourishes but that Ethan recognized instantly: warding against ill intent, encouraging safe passage, calling harmony into the space.

His throat tightened.

The deeper he looked, the more he saw the evidence of a decade's worth of work and care. The building itself had been renovated since his time—new roof, extended deck, the foundation reinforced. Someone had invested in this place, believed in it, poured resources into making it matter. The Maple Hollow he'd left had been struggling, its magic brittle with the strain of young people departing, families scattering. Seeing it thriving was disorienting.

Finally, he pushed open the car door.

The air hit him immediately—applewood smoke, wet leaves, cinnamon spice from somewhere inside the café. And underneath it all, that signature scent of October in Maple Hollow: earth and turning season, magic settling like dew on everything. Ethan stood for a moment beside the car, letting the sensations wash through him, cataloging his body's responses.

His pulse had quickened slightly. His shoulders had risen toward his ears—tension held in muscle memory. The small hairs on his arms were standing, responding to something in the air that his human brain couldn't quite process but his wolf understood perfectly: *Home. Danger. Change.*

He closed the car door with deliberate gentleness and straightened his jacket—a nervous habit he'd never quite managed to shake despite twelve years of training as a professional observer. The recorder hung heavy in his pocket. The camera bag across his chest felt like armor, or perhaps like camouflage; he couldn't quite decide which.

Taking a breath that felt steadier than it actually was, Ethan turned toward the café.

His journalist's eye took in everything with practiced detachment: storefronts draped in russet wreaths, early festival booths being erected in the square, locals who paused to look at his unfamiliar car. The scene was almost aggressively picturesque, like something from a travel brochure about charming autumn getaways.

What the brochure would omit was how the cider shop owner could charm weather forecasts into her bottles, or how the barber moonlighted as a bear during full moons. Magic, to Maple Hollow, wasn't mystic or even particularly special—just another local industry, like maple syrup or gossip.

"Are you planning to actually enter town, or just haunt our parking lot?"

The voice startled Ethan badly enough that his elbow slipped off the window edge. He turned to find Mayor Dorothea Vance peering in at him, her silver-streaked bun catching light like a crown. Despite her seventy-some years, she stood straight-backed in a mustard cardigan, regarding him with the particular blend of amusement and assessment that hadn't changed since she'd caught him sneaking out past curfew at sixteen.

"Mayor Vance." He cleared his throat, tucking the recorder into his jacket pocket as he opened the car door. "I was just—"

"Gathering courage?" Her eyebrow arched. "Calculating escape routes? Planning your exposé on backwoods lycanthropy?"

"Taking notes," he replied, surprised at how easily they fell into their old rhythm. "Journalistic habit."

She snorted, the sound unexpectedly warm. "Well, don't waste your ink. We haven't changed that much." Her shrewd eyes swept over him. "You have, though. All city polish and careful words now."

Ethan stepped out, straightening to his full height—taller than he'd been when he left, though still a few inches shy of the mayor's imposing presence. The air hit him then: applewood smoke, wet leaves, and something spiced that made his chest ache with unwanted recognition.

"Welcome home, city boy," Mayor Vance said, her voice softening almost imperceptibly. "We still remember your coffee order and your teenage rebellion."

"Just the coffee will do," he replied, the quip automatic even as something in him loosened at her use of "home."

She chuckled. "Your cousin's been buzzing around town all week, telling everyone you're here to write about the festival. What's the real story, Ethan Cole? The *Gazette* hasn't brought in outside talent since that flood piece in '08."

Before he could respond, a whirlwind of flannel and dark curls like his own bounded across the street, waving a phone mounted with a small microphone.

"Ethan! You're early!" Ruby Cole, his father's brother's daughter, skidded to a stop before him. At twenty-four, she was no longer the gangly teen who'd cried at his departure, but a vibrant young woman with a sharp smile and knowing eyes. "I told Mom you'd come through town instead of taking the back way to the paper. You owe me ten bucks."

"I don't recall entering that bet," he said, surprised to find himself smiling.

Ruby ignored this, already angling her phone toward him. "So, Ethan Cole, prodigal reporter returns to the scene of his youth. How does it feel to be back in Maple Hollow after—how many years?"

"His journalist's eye took in everything with practiced detachment: storefronts draped in russet wreaths, early festival booths being erected in the square, locals who paused to look at his unfamiliar car. The scene was almost aggressively picturesque, like something from a travel brochure about charming autumn getaways.

What the brochure would omit was how the cider shop owner could charm weather forecasts into her bottles, or how the barber moonlighted as a bear during full moons. Magic, to Maple Hollow, wasn't mystic or even particularly special—just another local industry, like maple syrup or gossip.

"Are you planning to actually enter town, or just haunt our parking lot?"

The voice startled Ethan badly enough that his elbow slipped off the car door. He turned to find Mayor Dorothea Vance peering in at him, her silver-streaked bun catching the afternoon light like a crown. Despite her seventy-some years, she stood straight-backed in a mustard cardigan—the same color she'd worn when she was mayor eleven years ago, he was certain of it—regarding him with the particular blend of amusement and assessment that hadn't changed since she'd caught him sneaking out past curfew at sixteen.

"Mayor Vance." He cleared his throat, tucking the recorder into his jacket pocket as he opened the car door. "I was just—"

"Gathering courage?" She stepped back to give him room, her keen eyes tracking his every movement. "Calculating escape routes? Planning your exposé on backwoods lycanthropy?"

"Taking notes," he replied, surprised at how easily they fell into their old rhythm. "Journalistic habit."

She snorted, the sound unexpectedly warm. "Well, don't waste your ink. We haven't changed that much." Her shrewd eyes swept over him, taking in the city cut of his hair, the careful tailoring of his jacket, the careful distance he held from the world. "You have, though. All city polish and careful words now."

Ethan stepped out, straightening to his full height—taller than he'd been when he left, though still a few inches shy of the mayor's imposing presence. The air hit him again: that particular Maple Hollow autumn that made his chest ache. "People grow, move on—"

"Grow, yes. Move on?" Mayor Vance's smile turned knowing. "Not the Maple Hollow way. We stay. We hold tight to what matters. And usually, the ones who leave come home eventually, whether they plan to or not."

There was something almost gentle in her voice, but underneath it ran a current of truth that Ethan didn't want to examine too closely. He shifted his weight. "I'm here for the Festival piece. Short assignment. Few weeks, then back to the city."

"Mmm." She stepped closer, her hand coming out to touch his shoulder—a gesture that was both maternal and quietly commanding. "Marcus Cole's boy, running away and calling it ambition. Some things don't change either, do they?"

The mention of his father, dead now for three years from a heart attack that Ethan had learned about through Ruby's email rather than hearing it in person, landed harder than expected. He'd sent flowers. He hadn't come home for the funeral. The distance was practical; it was professional; it was also, his therapist had gently suggested, cowardly.

"I'm here now," he managed.

Mayor Vance squeezed his shoulder, not unkindly. "Yes, you are. And the town's excited, truly. Ruby's been broadcasting your arrival all week like it's headline news." She paused, studying his face carefully. "We've had changes in the twelve years you've been gone, Ethan. Good changes. The pack's been strong under solid leadership. The harvest has been generous. And there's someone doing remarkable things with pack safety protocols—would've pleased your father, actually."

Something in her tone shifted subtly. Ethan's instincts—the ones his wolf had never let him dull, no matter how hard he tried—perked up instantly. "Pack safety? That's not something—"

"New initiatives," Mayor Vance said smoothly. "Long-term thinking. The kind of person who cares about legacy, not just immediate comfort." She watched him carefully. "But we can discuss that at the kickoff committee meeting tomorrow. Four o'clock, town hall."

Before Ethan could respond, a whirlwind of flannel and dark curls like his own bounded across the street, waving a phone mounted with a small microphone.

"Ethan! You're early!" Ruby Cole, his father's brother's daughter, skidded to a stop before him, nearly colliding with Mayor Vance. At twenty-four, she was no longer the gangly teen who'd cried at his departure, but a vibrant young woman with a sharp smile and knowing eyes that reminded him uncomfortably of the mirror. "I told Mom you'd come through town instead of taking the back way to the paper. You owe me ten bucks."

"I don't recall entering that bet," he said, surprised to find himself smiling despite the emotional whiplash of the last five minutes.

Ruby ignored this, already angling her phone toward him, her energy filling the parking lot like spilled electricity. "So, Ethan Cole, prodigal reporter returns to the scene of his youth. How does it feel to be back in Maple Hollow after—how many years?"

Mayor Vance was already stepping back, giving them space with practiced grace. "I'll see you tomorrow, young man. And Ethan? Whatever you left behind, it's still here. Sometimes that's a gift, even when it doesn't feel like it."

She walked away before he could respond, her straight spine impossibly dignified.

"Are you recording this?" Ethan asked, refocusing on Ruby, who was practically vibrating with barely contained excitement.

"Podcast," she confirmed, the small red light on her phone's mic attachment winking steadily. "*Hollow Whispers*. Local color, supernatural spotlights, that kind of thing. You're my first returning native interview. This is gold, frankly."

"I'm flattered, but I don't think—"

"Come on, one quote for your favorite cousin?" Her smile was pure Cole family charm, the same his father had used to coax shy shifters into community picnics. It was disarming and familiar and made something in Ethan's chest ache for reasons he couldn't articulate. "Call it professional courtesy. I'm building an actual audience. We have subscribers in twelve states."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Twelve states wants to hear about Maple Hollow folklore?"

"People want to believe in magic," Ruby said simply. "It matters that somewhere real, somewhere like this still exists." She tilted the microphone toward him with the practiced ease of someone who'd done this a hundred times. "So? One soundbite?"

Ethan sighed, recognizing defeat. "Fine. One soundbite."

"Excellent! Journalist Ethan Cole returns to cover our annual Harvest Moon Festival after twelve years away. What brings you back now?"

He brushed an invisible piece of lint from his sleeve, his eyes drifting back toward the forest beyond the parking lot, where cedar scent still hung in the air. "Just a short piece on small-town autumn traditions. Editor thought a local angle might help with the human interest factor."

"Uh-huh." Ruby's tone made it clear she didn't believe him for a second. She always had been the only one who could call him on his bullshit, maybe because she loved him enough not to pretend. "Nothing to do with the fact that this year's Harvest Moon coincides with a rare lunar alignment that supposedly amplifies everything? Or that you left right after the last big festival?" Her grin turned teasing. "They say anyone who runs from the Hollow always comes back when the Moon calls their name."

"They say a lot of things here," he countered, his voice carefully neutral despite the sudden tightness in his chest. The claim was too close to truth for comfort. "Most of them exaggerated."

"Says the boy who grew up watching Old Mr. Jenkins turn into a black bear every full moon."

"Man turns into bear. Film at eleven," Ethan deadpanned, falling into their old pattern so easily it alarmed him. "Doesn't exactly make headlines in Maple Hollow."

Ruby laughed, the sound drawing glances from a couple on the café's porch. Her eyes, so much like his father's, crinkled with genuine delight. "God, I've missed you. Nobody else gets my jokes."

The simple sincerity disarmed him completely. Ethan felt his carefully constructed distance falter, warmth seeping through despite his best efforts. He reached out and ruffled her hair like he used to, before he'd left, before everything had become complicated. "I've missed you too, kid."

"I'm not a kid," she protested, though she was grinning. "But you're not allowed to disappear again for twelve years without a solid explanation and multiple video calls."

"I'll do my best," he said, and meant it, which was its own kind of problem.

Ruby clicked off her recorder. "So, quick logistics: the *Gazette* office is still two blocks east of here. Ruby Alvarez—she's Nico's wife now, by the way, they got married five years ago in the most beautiful ceremony, you missed a thing—is expecting you at three thirty. She's the editor now, and she's genuinely excited to meet you. Also wants to discuss the scope of the piece."

"Right," he said, glancing at his phone. 3:07. "I should probably head over there now."

"Sure, sure." Ruby tucked her phone away, sliding it into the flannel shirt that appeared to be her personal uniform. "But the *Hollow Whispers* audience will just have to wait for the full interview. Tonight? Mom's making venison stew, and she'll literally cry if you don't come. Not the easy kind of tears either—she's been stress-baking for three days."

Ethan's throat tightened. Ruby's mother, his aunt Sophie, had practically raised him during his teenage years when his own father had been drowning in grief over Ethan's mother's death. He hadn't thought about that in years, hadn't let himself think about it.

"That's really nice of her," he said carefully. "But I'm pretty tired from the drive—"

"Ethan." Ruby fixed him with a look that somehow contained all the wisdom of the sister-figure she'd become despite their actual relation. "It's been twelve years. Give us one dinner."

The guilt hit harder than he'd expected. Ruby had been twelve when he left, old enough to feel abandoned but too young to understand why he couldn't stay. Now she stood before him, offering a bridge he wasn't sure he deserved.

"Fine," he relented. "Dinner. But I'm not promising any heartfelt revelations or dramatic reunions."

"Just food and family," she agreed, eyes twinkling. "And maybe just a tiny update on what you're really doing here."

Before he could protest, Ruby had bounced away, calling over her shoulder: "Seven o'clock! No excuses! Mom's making apple pie!"

Ethan watched her go, feeling oddly hollow in her wake. He turned back toward his car, intending to drive the short distance to the *Gazette*, but found himself drawn toward the square instead. His body needed to move, needed to process, needed something that wasn't the confining space of his Subaru or the inevitable awkwardness of his family's expectations."

"Podcast," she confirmed. "*Hollow Whispers*. Local color, supernatural spotlights, that kind of thing. You're my first returning native interview."

"I'm flattered, but I don't think—"

"Come on, one quote for your favorite cousin?" Her smile was pure Cole family charm, the same his father had used to coax shy shifters into community picnics. "Call it professional courtesy."

Mayor Vance chuckled. "I'll leave you to the family reunion. Stop by the town hall tomorrow, Ethan—kickoff committee meets at four, and we could use a fresh perspective." She paused. "And someone to correct Jasper's grammar on the banners."

As she walked away, Ruby raised an expectant eyebrow, microphone still hovering.

Ethan sighed. "Fine. One soundbite."

"Excellent! So, journalist Ethan Cole returns to cover our annual Harvest Moon Festival after twelve years away. What brings you back now?"

He brushed an invisible piece of lint from his sleeve. "Just a short piece on small-town autumn traditions. Editor thought a local angle might help with the human interest factor."

Ruby laughed, the sound drawing glances from a couple on the café's porch. Her eyes, so much like his father's, crinkled with genuine delight. "God, I've missed you. Nobody else gets my jokes."

The simple sincerity disarmed him. Ethan felt his carefully constructed distance falter, warmth seeping through despite his best efforts. He gestured vaguely toward the café. "Does Malcolm still make that maple pecan cold brew?"

"With extra foam, just for you." Ruby clicked off her recorder. "But you've got ten minutes before your scheduled check-in at the *Gazette*. Ruby Alvarez—Nico's wife now, by the way—is expecting you."

Of course she was. Nothing in Maple Hollow happened without the entire town's immediate knowledge, schedule coordination, and betting pool.

"Right," he said, glancing at the road leading toward the newspaper office. "I should probably..."

"Sure, sure." Ruby tucked her phone away. "The *Hollow Whispers* audience will just have to wait for the full interview. Tonight? Mom's making venison stew, and she'll literally cry if you don't come."

"I'm pretty tired from the drive—"

"Ethan." She fixed him with a look that sliced through his excuse. "It's been twelve years. Give us one dinner."

The guilt hit harder than he'd expected. Ruby had been twelve when he left, old enough to feel abandoned but too young to understand why he couldn't stay. Now she stood before him, offering a bridge he wasn't sure he deserved.

"Fine," he relented. "Dinner. But I'm not promising any heartfelt revelations or dramatic reunions."

Before he could protest, Ruby had bounced away, calling over her shoulder: "Seven o'clock! No excuses!"

Ethan watched her go, feeling oddly hollow in her wake. He turned back toward his car, intending to drive the short distance to the *Gazette*, but found himself drawn toward the square instead. His body needed to move, needed to process, needed something that wasn't the confining space of his Subaru or the inevitable awkwardness of his family's expectations.

Across the square, someone had hung festival bunting from lampposts—copper and deep green ribbons that twisted in the light breeze like they were alive, animated by the wind itself. The effect was beautiful in a way that made something in Ethan's chest feel exposed. Maple Hollow had always been beautiful, but it had never quite learned to be subtle about it.

He started walking, his steps deliberate, tracking the changes and constants of the town he'd spent the first twenty-five years of his life in. The gazebo had been repainted since his time—its white columns gleamed against the backdrop of mist-shrouded mountains—but the carved railing was the same weathered oak he remembered, marked here and there with initials and dates from a hundred years of townspeople. He could probably find his own initials if he looked hard enough. *E.C. + C.M.* carved hastily during an autumn festival when he was seventeen and thought the world would let him keep what he wanted.

The water tower stood sentinel over the eastern edge of town, its silhouette crowned by the distinctive wolf-shaped weathervane that had been there since before his birth. The symbol wasn't subtle—nothing in Maple Hollow was subtle to anyone who knew how to look—but it worked because most people saw it as charming local history rather than a literal weather vane on the home of a pack of werewolves.

He lingered at the gazebo's steps, taking in the scene. Vendors were setting up booths in neat rows—produce stands, craft tables, the usual carnival aesthetic of small-town festivals. But Ethan knew better than most that these booths had a secondary purpose. During the Harvest Moon, the festival became a kind of anchor point, a way to keep the pack's changes gentle and managed, embedded within human structure and normalcy.

"Ethan Cole. I'll be damned."

He turned to find a woman his age approaching from the direction of the arts-and-crafts booth, paint-stained jeans and a Maple Hollow High School sweatshirt identifying her as someone local. Her face took a moment to place, but then it clicked: Sarah Michaels. He'd kissed her once at a football game. She'd gone to college for art and apparently had come back.

"Sarah. Good to see you," he said, and meant it—her presence felt less fraught than some of the others he'd already encountered.

"I heard the rumor but didn't really believe it until now," Sarah said, hand coming to rest on a display of fall-painted gourds. "Twelve years is a long time. You look... different. More yourself, maybe? Less angry."

The observation caught him off guard. "That's a generous read."

"I'm an artist. I notice faces." She smiled, and there was something kind in it, without being pitying. "We missed you. Some of us, anyway. But also—people understood why you left. Not everyone has it in them to stay and watch the person they love love someone else."

Ethan's heart rate spiked. He opened his mouth to respond, but Sarah was already shaking her head.

"I'm not fishing, don't worry. I'm married now, actually. Two kids. Good life." She gestured at the booth. "Just saying—we all know Caleb's been Alpha for the past eight years. Doing a good job of it too. But people remember what it was like before, how you two..." She trailed off tactfully. "Anyway. Welcome home."

She turned back to her booth, leaving Ethan standing in the center of the square with his pulse doing complex calculations. Caleb was Alpha. Eight years. That meant he'd taken over around the time Ethan's father died, around the time Ethan had stopped checking the town forums and reading pack updates.

The realization landed like a stone in still water.

A scent crossed his path, faint but undeniable: cedar and pine, with an undercurrent of something wilder—forest after rain, fur warmed by sunlight, specifically warm from exertion or emotion. Ethan's pulse stuttered, a reflex he hated himself for preserving after so many years.

It was just a ghost in the wind, just an echo carried across town from somewhere he couldn't quite track. But it was enough to send a shiver of awareness down his spine, enough to remind him that Maple Hollow preserved all kinds of memories, not just the ones contained in photo albums or conversations with exes at craft booths.

He stood there for another moment, breathing carefully, letting the pulse of the square move around him. Other locals continued their preparations, setting up tables, stringing lights, organizing supplies. Nobody else seemed to notice the way the air had shifted, the way the forest beyond the town's edge suddenly felt closer, more attentive.

"It's just a story," he murmured to himself, squaring his shoulders and taking a deliberate step away from the gazebo, back toward the café and the promise of coffee that might ground him in something concrete. He was here for the Festival, for a simple feature about small-town magic made palatable for city readers. A week, maybe two, and he'd be gone again. No complications, no reopening old wounds.

He was lying to himself, and not even very convincingly—but it was enough to get his feet moving toward the café at last.

The Howl & Bean's interior was warmer than he expected, all deep wood and carefully curated autumn ambiance. The barista station gleamed with new equipment—someone had invested money here, cared about quality. String lights twisted between exposed beams, casting gentle pooled light across worn leather couches and bistro tables. There was a fireplace radiating warmth into the October afternoon, and the air smelled like what autumn should smell like: cinnamon, apple, the deep earthiness of real coffee.

Behind the counter, someone familiar was pulling espresso shots with the focused intensity of an artist at work.

It took Ethan a moment to place him. Malcolm, he thought. Malcolm Rodriguez. They'd gone to high school together—Malcolm had been two years older, part of the arts crowd. He'd gone to college in California; the last Ethan had heard, he'd been doing something in tech.

"Be with you in just a second," Malcolm called, not looking up from his work. His hands moved with the muscle memory of someone who'd been doing this for a long time, not just dabbling. "Making a cortado for—"

He glanced up, and his expression shifted. Recognition flickered across his face, then something more complicated: warmth, history, the particular knowledge that comes from sharing a hometown.

"Holy shit," Malcolm said, setting down his espresso cup carefully. "Ethan Cole. Welcome back."

"Malcolm. Good to see you," Ethan said, surprised at how genuine it felt. "I didn't expect... I mean, last I heard, you were in California?"

"Did my time there," Malcolm said, wiping down the espresso group with practiced care. "Realized I missed actual seasons, actual community. Came back about four years ago, bought into the Howl & Bean. Best decision I ever made." He smiled, and it was a real smile—not forced, not pitying. "So you're back for the festival? I heard through the town grapevine that the *Gazette* was bringing in an outside journalist."

"For a feature piece," Ethan confirmed, moving to the counter. "Just a few weeks to cover the Harvest Moon Festival from a local angle."

"Few weeks, huh?" Malcolm's expression grew thoughtful. "That's what I said too, except about four years. Something about this place just... holds on to you, even when you try to leave."

Ethan wasn't sure how to respond to that, so he defaulted to practical: "What's good today?"

"Depends on your mood," Malcolm said, already reaching for equipment. "You look like you could use something grounding. The maple pecan cold brew is particularly good this time of year—I steep it with real cinnamon and a touch of vanilla. Smooth, comforting, doesn't interfere with clear thinking."

"Exactly what I need," Ethan said.

As Malcolm worked, Ethan found himself watching the easy competence of someone who'd clearly found their place in the world. There was peace in the way Malcolm moved, contentment in the meticulous care he took with each drink. He'd built something here. He'd come home and made it work.

"Here you go," Malcolm said, setting a carefully crafted drink in front of Ethan. The cold brew was the color of burnt honey, with cream swirled on top in a deliberate spiral. "First one's on the house. Welcome home."

Ethan took a sip, and something in his chest unclenched. It was exactly what he needed: rich and smooth, with that particular combination of flavors that tasted like autumn specifically, like Maple Hollow specifically. Like home.

"This is incredible," he said honestly.

"Thanks. Took me a while to get the ratio right." Malcolm leaned against the counter. "So, is this just about the festival, or are you actually considering staying? Because town could use you, honestly. We've had some changes in the pack dynamics that could benefit from outside perspective."

"I'm just here for work," Ethan said quickly. "After the piece is done, I'll head back to the city."

"Okay," Malcolm said, and he didn't push, which was kind. "But if you change your mind, or if you need coffee recommendations while you're here, I'm available. Also, fair warning: the whole town's going to pretend they don't care you're back while actively caring enormously. It's very Maple Hollow."

Ethan laughed, surprised at how genuine it felt. "I remember. Twelve years and I don't think that's changed."

"Some things don't," Malcolm agreed. "But some things have. Might be worth seeing what's different, while you're here."

Ethan took his coffee and headed toward the door, pausing only to exchange contact information with Malcolm. There was something grounding about the interaction, something that suggested Maple Hollow might be hospitable to his presence after all. Not everyone was going to be complicated. Not every conversation would require negotiation with his own complicated feelings.

The afternoon light had shifted while he'd been inside, turning golden and thick. The *Gazette* office was close now, just two blocks east of the café. Ruby would be expecting him. There would be schedules and logistics and the professional work of being a journalist assigned to cover a story.

For a few hours, at least, that would be enough to keep him occupied. It would be enough to keep his mind from circling back to cedar and rain and the particular way the forest had smelled when he'd first stepped out of his car.

It would be enough until evening, when family dinner waited, when he'd have to face Ruby and his aunt and all the accumulated years of absence and choice and the particular ache of coming home to people who remembered him better than he remembered himself.

For now, coffee and work and the manageable challenges of professional journalism. That was the framework he could operate within.
