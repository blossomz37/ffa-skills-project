The world smelled of coffee and wet pine, and for once Ethan didn't feel like a visitor in his own skin.

He lay in Caleb's bed, tangled in sheets that smelled like woodsmoke and the faint musk of shifter—a scent that had terrified him once, years ago, when he was eighteen and too afraid of wanting something he couldn't control. Now it just felt like home.

Sunlight filtered through the cabin windows, soft and golden, cutting through the lingering morning mist that clung to the pines outside. The light painted everything in warm amber: the rough-hewn beams overhead, the flannel shirt draped over the chair, Caleb's shoulder where it pressed against his side, solid and sleep-warm.

Ethan turned his head on the pillow. Caleb was still asleep, face relaxed in a way it never was during waking hours. The lines of tension around his eyes had smoothed out. His hair, normally tied back, fell loose across the pillow in shades of honey and bronze. One arm was slung across Ethan's chest, heavy and possessive even in sleep.

*Mine*, something whispered in Ethan's chest. *Actually, impossibly mine.*

He didn't move. Didn't want to break the spell of this moment—the quiet, the light, the simple fact of Caleb breathing beside him. They'd stayed up late last night, talking until their voices went hoarse, touching until their hands learned the landscape of each other's bodies again. Building something honest. Something that could last.

The festival was over. The full moon had set. And they were still here, together, in the gentle aftermath of magic and truth.

From somewhere in the cabin's small kitchen, the coffee maker beeped. Caleb had set it on a timer last night—*force of habit*, he'd said, laughing—and now the rich, dark aroma filled the air, mixing with pine and the faint smoky sweetness of last night's fire.

Caleb stirred. His arm tightened around Ethan's ribs, pulling him closer before his eyes even opened. A rumble of contentment vibrated through his chest.

"Morning," Ethan murmured.

Caleb's eyes opened slowly, green and gold in the dawn light, unfocused with sleep. Then they sharpened, landing on Ethan's face, and something impossibly soft crossed his expression.

"You're still here," Caleb said. His voice was rough, gravelly with sleep.

"Where else would I be?"

"I don't know. Part of me expected to wake up and find this was a dream." Caleb's thumb traced a slow circle against Ethan's ribs, just above his hip. "That you'd be gone again."

Ethan shifted onto his side, facing him. "I'm not going anywhere. I told you that."

"I know." Caleb's expression was almost sheepish. "Old fears die hard."

"Then I'll just have to keep proving it." Ethan leaned in and kissed him—slow and soft, tasting sleep and promises. When he pulled back, Caleb was smiling. "Coffee's ready."

"Best alarm clock I've ever had."

They disentangled slowly, reluctantly. Caleb found a pair of sweatpants and pulled them on, while Ethan borrowed one of his flannel shirts—the same one from last night, still carrying the scent of applewood smoke and October air. It was too big, sleeves hanging past his hands, but it was warm and soft and *Caleb's*, which made it perfect.

The cabin was small, just one main room with a kitchenette tucked into the corner, a stone fireplace dominating one wall, and a sleeping loft above. Rustic, functional, built for a man who valued simplicity over luxury. But the light streaming through the windows made it feel larger, golden and welcoming.

Caleb moved through the space with the easy grace of someone who'd lived here long enough to know every inch. He pulled two mugs from the cabinet—one forest green, one deep amber—and filled them both, the steam curling up in lazy spirals.

Ethan settled at the small kitchen table, watching. Caleb's shoulders were relaxed, movements unhurried. No Alpha mask this morning. Just Caleb, barefoot and sleep-rumpled, making coffee in his own kitchen like this was the most natural thing in the world.

*This could be every morning*, Ethan thought, and the realization didn't scare him the way it might have a month ago. A week ago. Even yesterday. It just felt... right.

Caleb set the amber mug in front of him. "Cream?"

"Black's fine."

"Liar." Caleb retrieved the cream from the fridge and set it down with a knowing look. "You've always taken cream. You just pretend you don't because you think it makes you look tougher."

Ethan laughed despite himself. "I forgot you knew that."

"I know a lot of things about you." Caleb settled into the chair across from him, cradling his own mug. "Like how you tap your pen three times before writing anything important. And how you can't stand the sound of styrofoam. And how you get this little crease between your eyebrows when you're thinking too hard."

"That's not fair. You've been cataloging my habits for twelve years."

"Thirteen, actually." Caleb's smile was gentle. "I started the summer you came back from college that first time. Couldn't help myself."

Ethan added cream to his coffee, watching it swirl and blend. "What else do you remember?"

"Everything." The word hung between them, simple and devastating. "The way you used to steal my hoodies. How you'd read in the tavern corner with your feet tucked under you. The sound you make when you're about to laugh but trying not to." Caleb took a sip of coffee. "I remember all of it, Ethan. I never stopped."

The weight of that settled in Ethan's chest—not heavy, just... present. Real. The kind of weight that felt like gravity instead of burden.

"I remember things too," Ethan said quietly. "Like how you always hold doors open for people, even when they don't notice. And how you check the ward ribbons every night before bed. And how your eyes change color depending on the moon phase."

"Observant journalist."

"Observant ex-boyfriend who never really got over you."

Caleb's expression softened. "We're not exes anymore."

"No," Ethan agreed, smiling. "We're not."

They drank their coffee in companionable silence, watching the sunlight inch across the floor. Outside, birds called to each other through the mist. The world felt quiet and new, like they were the first people to discover morning.

Eventually, Caleb stood and opened the fridge. "Breakfast?"

"What are my options?"

"Eggs. Toast. Bacon if you don't mind it slightly burnt."

"Your cooking hasn't improved, then."

"I'm an Alpha, not a chef." Caleb pulled out a carton of eggs and a package of bacon. "Besides, you're the one who used to burn water when we were eighteen. I distinctly remember a smoking teakettle incident."

"That was one time."

"It was three times."

"Okay, three times. But I've improved."

"Have you, though?"

Ethan threw a dish towel at him. Caleb caught it one-handed, grinning, and Ethan felt something warm and bright bloom in his chest. This. This easy teasing, this comfortable domesticity. This was what he'd been missing all these years—not just the romance, but the *partnership*. The shared laughter over breakfast, the casual intimacy of knowing someone well enough to joke about their cooking disasters.

Caleb cooked while Ethan watched, occasionally offering commentary that was ignored with good-natured stubbornness. The bacon did end up slightly burnt, but the eggs were perfect—fluffy and golden, seasoned with herbs from the small pot on the windowsill. They ate at the table, knees bumping beneath the wood, talking about nothing and everything.

"What time did the festival actually end?" Ethan asked between bites of toast.

"Around two in the morning. Mara did a final ward check, made sure everyone got home safe. No incidents."

"That's good." Ethan paused. "I'm still not entirely sure what happened last night. On stage, I mean. When you said all those things."

Caleb looked at him steadily. "I told the truth. That's what happened."

"I know, but..." Ethan set down his fork, trying to find the right words. "You didn't have to do that. Put yourself out there like that. Risk the pack seeing you as—"

"As what? Human?" Caleb's voice was gentle but firm. "Ethan, I spent twelve years being the perfect Alpha. Controlled. Distant. Never letting anyone see that I was lonely or scared or just... wanting something for myself. It didn't make me stronger. It just made me alone." He reached across the table, covering Ethan's hand with his own. "Last night, I chose you over that loneliness. And I'd do it again. Every time."

Ethan turned his hand over, threading their fingers together. "You don't regret it?"

"Not even a little bit." Caleb squeezed his hand. "Do you?"

"No. God, no." Ethan laughed, the sound coming out shaky. "I'm just... trying to believe this is real. That we get to have this."

"We do. We really do."

A knock at the door interrupted the moment—three sharp raps followed by a cheerful voice. "Caleb? You decent? We brought pie."

Caleb closed his eyes briefly, fighting a smile. "That's Mara."

"And Jasper," another voice added. "With leftover apple cinnamon. Open up before I eat it all myself."

Ethan laughed. "Should we let them in?"

"If we don't, they'll just break down the door." Caleb stood and crossed to the entrance, unlocking it. "You two are like mosquitoes. Persistent and annoying."

Mara swept in first, carrying a covered pie dish, her red hair bright even in the cabin's muted light. She wore jeans and an oversized cardigan that looked suspiciously like it belonged to Jasper, and her expression was pure mischief. "Good morning, lovebirds. Hope we're not interrupting anything."

"Just breakfast," Caleb said dryly.

"Sure." Jasper followed her in, taller and broader, dark-skinned with close-cropped hair and an easy grin. He balanced a second dish in one hand. "We also brought coffee cake. Figured you'd be hungry after all that... talking last night."

Ethan felt heat creep up his neck. "We were talking."

"Oh, we know." Mara set the pie on the counter and turned to face them, eyes sparkling. "The whole town knows. Mrs. Chen called me at six in the morning to tell me she felt the emotional shift in the ward ribbons. Apparently, they're glowing brighter than they have in years."

"The wards respond to community harmony," Jasper explained, leaning against the counter. "When people are happy, when the town feels settled, the magic stabilizes. Last night's festival energy was already strong, but this morning? The ribbons are practically singing."

Caleb looked slightly embarrassed. "The ribbons are fine. Everything's fine."

"Everything's better than fine," Mara corrected. She crossed to Ethan and pulled him into a hug, surprising him. "Welcome back. Officially this time."

Ethan hugged her back, throat suddenly tight. "Thanks, Mara."

"You're pack now," she said simply, pulling away. "Or as good as. That means you're stuck with us. Hope you're ready for weekly tavern nights and way too much pack gossip."

"I think I can handle it."

"Good." She turned to Caleb. "We're not staying long. Just wanted to drop these off and check in. Mayor Vance is organizing a post-festival cleanup this afternoon if you want to volunteer. Ruby's handling the Gazette office—apparently, she's already fielding interview requests about last night's speech."

Caleb groaned. "Of course she is."

"You did declare your love in front of two hundred people," Jasper pointed out reasonably. "Under a full moon. During a magical festival. That's news, Alpha."

"It was supposed to be a private moment."

"On a public stage," Mara added, grinning. "With a microphone."

"With a *working* microphone," Jasper clarified. "Important distinction."

Ethan couldn't hold back his laughter anymore. It bubbled up, bright and genuine, and Caleb shot him a look that was half exasperation, half affection.

"Glad you find this amusing," Caleb muttered.

"I really do." Ethan caught his hand, squeezing once. "But they're right. You were on a stage. With a microphone. Declaring your love. For me. In front of the entire town."

"I'm aware."

"It was very romantic."

"Also very public," Mara added.

"And probably going to be a podcast episode," Jasper said. "Ruby mentioned recording rights."

Caleb looked pained. "Please tell me she's not actually making this a podcast."

"Oh, she absolutely is." Mara's grin widened. "She's calling it 'Love Under the Harvest Moon: A Maple Hollow Romance.' She wants to interview you both."

"Hard pass," Ethan said immediately.

"Same," Caleb agreed.

"Your loss." Mara shrugged, unrepentant. "Anyway, we'll get out of your hair. Enjoy the pie. Enjoy each other. We'll see you at cleanup later?"

"Maybe," Caleb said.

"Definitely," Mara corrected, already heading for the door. "You're the Alpha. You have to show up."

"I could take the day off."

"You absolutely could not." But Jasper clapped him on the shoulder as he passed, voice gentling. "Good to see you happy, Cal. Really."

And then they were gone, the door clicking shut behind them, leaving only the lingering scent of apples and cinnamon and the warm echo of their teasing.

Ethan looked at Caleb. "Your pack is..."

"Intrusive?"

"I was going to say wonderful."

Caleb's expression softened. "They are. Pain in my ass most of the time, but wonderful." He moved back to the table, settling into his chair. "You okay with all of this? The attention, I mean. Everyone knowing."

"Yeah." Ethan realized he meant it. "I spent so long trying to keep secrets, trying to protect myself by staying distant. But this? Being open about us? It actually feels... freeing."

"Even with Ruby's podcast ambitions?"

"Even with that." Ethan grinned. "Though I'm not agreeing to an interview."

"Smart man."

They finished breakfast slowly, trading bites of pie and coffee cake, occasionally reaching across the table to touch—a brush of fingers, a squeeze of the hand. Simple contact that said *I'm here, you're here, we're real*.

Eventually, Caleb stood and started clearing dishes. Ethan helped, moving around the small kitchen with an ease that felt like muscle memory. They'd done this before, years ago, in Caleb's tiny apartment above the tavern. Back when they were young and stupid and thought love was simple.

It wasn't simple. But it was worth it.

"What now?" Ethan asked, drying the last plate.

Caleb leaned against the counter, arms crossed, considering. "Well. You're staying in Maple Hollow."

"I am."

"And you're going to keep writing."

"That's the plan. Ruby offered me a permanent position at the Gazette, but I'm thinking I might go freelance instead. Write about the things that matter. Community pieces, features on local businesses, maybe some travel writing if I can convince you to take a vacation occasionally."

Caleb's mouth quirked. "I haven't taken a vacation in five years."

"Then it's definitely time." Ethan set down the dish towel. "What about you? What do you want?"

"Honestly?" Caleb's gaze was steady, open. "I want what we had this morning. Coffee. Breakfast. You stealing my shirts. I want to wake up next to you and not wonder if you'll be gone when I open my eyes. I want..." He paused, searching for words. "I want ordinary. The kind of ordinary that's actually extraordinary because it's ours."

Ethan crossed to him, closing the distance. "I can do ordinary."

"Can you?" Caleb's hands found his hips, pulling him close. "Because I'm offering you a very boring life, Ethan Cole. Small-town routine. Tavern shifts. Pack meetings. Ward maintenance. The occasional full moon drama, but mostly just... this. Quiet mornings. Shared coffee. Growing old together in a cabin in the woods."

"Sounds perfect."

"You say that now."

"I mean it." Ethan cupped his face, thumb tracing the line of his jaw. "I spent twelve years chasing stories in cities that didn't care about me, living in apartments that never felt like home. I don't need adventure anymore, Caleb. I just need you. This. Us."

Caleb kissed him—soft and slow, tasting like coffee and promise. When they broke apart, his voice was rough. "Move in with me."

Ethan blinked. "What?"

"Move in. Properly. Not just staying over occasionally. Bring your things. Make this your home too." Caleb's hands tightened on his hips. "I know it's fast. Maybe too fast. But I've already lost twelve years with you. I don't want to waste any more time pretending we're not building something permanent."

"Caleb." Ethan's throat felt tight. "Are you sure?"

"I've never been more sure of anything."

Ethan thought about his tiny rental apartment above the coffee shop—the temporary space he'd chosen because he didn't plan to stay long. The bare walls. The boxes he'd never unpacked. The careful distance he'd maintained from anything that felt too permanent.

And then he looked around Caleb's cabin. The warm wood. The sunlight streaming through the windows. The coffee mugs on the counter. The easy comfort of a space lived in and loved.

"Okay," he said. "Yes. I'll move in."

Caleb's smile was brilliant, transforming his entire face. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Ethan laughed, giddy with the simple rightness of it. "Though you should know I'm a terrible roommate. I leave books everywhere. I forget to do dishes. I stay up too late writing and then drink all the coffee in the morning."

"I know. I remember."

"And you still want me to move in?"

"Especially because I remember." Caleb pulled him closer. "I want the books. The dirty dishes. The late nights and early mornings. I want all of it, Ethan. The messy, real, everyday parts of sharing a life."

Ethan buried his face against Caleb's shoulder, breathing him in. Pine and woodsmoke and home. "When you put it like that..."

"There's just one condition."

Ethan pulled back. "What?"

"You have to let me teach you to cook properly. I can't live with someone who burns water."

"That was thirteen years ago!"

"And yet I still have trauma."

Ethan laughed, the sound bright and free. "Fine. But only if you let me rearrange your bookshelf. Your organization system is chaos."

"It's alphabetical!"

"By author's *first* name. Like a psychopath."

"It's efficient!"

They were still arguing, still laughing, when Ethan leaned in and kissed him again. The argument dissolved into warmth, into the steady press of bodies, into the simple joy of being together and knowing this was just the beginning.

When they finally pulled apart, Caleb said, "We should probably get dressed. Cleanup starts in an hour."

"Or," Ethan suggested, fingers playing with the drawstring of Caleb's sweatpants, "we could skip it. Stay here. Spend the day figuring out where all my books are going to go."

"Tempting. But Mara will kill me if I don't show up."

"Good point." Ethan stepped back, reluctantly. "Guess we're being responsible adults today."

"Unfortunately."

They got ready slowly, trading space in the small bathroom, stealing kisses between brushing teeth and pulling on clothes. Ethan changed back into yesterday's jeans but kept Caleb's flannel shirt, rolling up the sleeves. It still smelled like festival smoke and autumn air.

Caleb watched him from the doorway, expression unreadable.

"What?" Ethan asked.

"Nothing. Just..." Caleb shook his head, smiling. "You look good in my clothes."

"I always did."

"I know. I remember."

They gathered what they needed—jackets, keys, the folded festival program that had somehow ended up on the kitchen table. Ethan picked it up, smoothing the creases. *One-Hundred-Forty-Third Harvest Moon Festival*, the cover read, decorated with hand-drawn lanterns and maple leaves.

"Keep it," Caleb said. "As a memento."

"Of what? The night you declared your love in front of two hundred people?"

"Of the night we stopped running from each other."

Ethan tucked the program into his jacket pocket, the paper crinkling softly. "Okay. Deal."

They headed outside together, stepping into the October morning. The mist had mostly burned off, leaving the world sharp and clear. Sunlight filtered through the pines, dappling the ground with gold. The air was cool and clean, carrying the scent of damp earth and wood smoke from distant fireplaces.

The cabin stood on the edge of Maple Hollow, tucked into the forest like a secret. From the porch, you could see the town spread out below—the cluster of buildings around Harvest Square, the church steeple rising above the trees, the winding roads that connected everything like veins carrying blood.

Ethan had always loved this view. Even as a teenager, sneaking up here with Caleb, he'd been struck by how peaceful it looked from this distance. How *whole*. All the messy, complicated parts of small-town life smoothed out by perspective and light.

He stood at the railing now, taking it in. Home. After all these years, after all the running, after all the fear—this was home.

Caleb came up beside him, close enough their shoulders brushed. "You okay?"

"Yeah." Ethan turned to look at him. The morning light caught in Caleb's eyes, turning them honey-gold. He looked younger somehow, the constant weight of Alpha responsibility lighter on his shoulders. "I'm good. Really good."

"Good." Caleb's hand found his, threading their fingers together. "Because we should probably head down. Cleanup waits for no one."

"Not even the Alpha?"

"Especially not the Alpha."

They stood there a moment longer, hands linked, looking out over the town. The last remnants of morning mist clung to the valleys. Birds called from the trees. And somewhere in the distance, a pack member howled—not in warning or summons, but in pure joy.

Caleb squeezed his hand. "Come on. Let's go home."

"We're already home," Ethan said.

"No." Caleb turned to him, smiling. "We're going to the town. To our people. To the community that's been waiting for us to figure this out." He tugged Ethan toward the steps. "That's home too."

They walked down together, following the path through the pines, their footsteps quiet on the damp earth. The forest opened up gradually, releasing them into the morning. By the time they reached the main road, other people were appearing—pack members heading toward Harvest Square, locals carrying trash bags and work gloves, tourists with cameras hoping to catch one more glimpse of Maple Hollow's magic.

Several people waved. A few called out greetings. Mrs. Chen, walking with her grandson, stopped them with a knowing smile. "Good morning, boys. Sleep well?"

"Very well, thank you," Caleb said, utterly deadpan.

"I'm sure you did." Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "The ward ribbons are singing this morning. Haven't seen them this bright since your parents' wedding, Caleb."

Caleb's ears went red. "Thank you for that information, Mrs. Chen."

"You're welcome." She patted his arm. "Come by the bakery tomorrow. I'm making celebration buns."

"Celebration buns?" Ethan asked after she'd walked away.

"Don't ask. Just accept them graciously and don't question the filling."

They continued through town, weaving through the familiar streets. The Wildwood Tavern stood dark and quiet, closed for the morning. The Gazette office had lights on—Ruby, no doubt, already working on follow-up articles. The community center buzzed with activity, people gathering supplies for cleanup.

Harvest Square looked different in daylight. The stage stood empty, its lanterns dark, ribbons fluttering gently in the breeze. Vendors were packing up their stalls. Volunteers moved through the crowd, picking up fallen programs and disposable cups, sweeping away the debris of celebration.

But the magic lingered. Ethan could feel it in the air—not oppressive or overwhelming, just... present. Like the town itself was humming with contentment.

Mara spotted them from across the square and jogged over, work gloves dangling from one hand. "There you are! I was starting to think you'd blown us off."

"We wouldn't dare," Caleb said.

"Smart." She tossed them each a pair of gloves. "You're on main stage duty. Jasper's coordinating trash collection. Ruby wants photos for the Gazette. And Mayor Vance wants to talk to you about making this an annual tradition."

"Making what an annual tradition?"

"The public declarations of love during festival ceremonies." Mara's grin was wicked. "He thinks it adds atmosphere."

Caleb looked pained. "Please tell me you're joking."

"Only a little." She squeezed his shoulder. "But seriously, good to see you both here. Together. The town's been talking about nothing else all morning."

"Of course they have," Ethan muttered.

"Hey, you're the ones who made it a spectacle." But Mara's voice was fond. "For what it's worth? I think it's wonderful. You deserve to be happy, Caleb. Both of you."

She jogged off before either of them could respond, leaving them standing in the middle of the square, gloves in hand, surrounded by the gentle chaos of community.

Caleb sighed. "Cleanup time."

"Could be worse."

"How?"

"We could be helping Ruby with the podcast."

Caleb laughed. "Good point."

They worked together, moving through the square with easy coordination. Caleb dismantled the stage while Ethan gathered fallen ribbons, coiling them carefully. The work was simple, physical, grounding. Around them, the town moved with the same purposeful energy—everyone pitching in, voices mingling, laughter cutting through the crisp October air.

It felt good. Normal. Like being part of something larger than himself.

At some point, Ruby appeared with her camera, snapping photos of the cleanup effort. "Ethan! Over here! I need a shot of you and Caleb for the article."

"What article?" Ethan asked warily.

"'After the Moon: How One Festival Brought Our Community Together.'" Ruby's grin was impish. "It's a follow-up piece. Very wholesome. You'll love it."

"Ruby—"

"Come on. Just one photo. I promise it's tasteful."

Ethan looked at Caleb, who shrugged helplessly. They posed together, standing near the stage, Caleb's arm around Ethan's shoulders. Ruby took the shot, then another, then three more for good measure.

"Perfect," she announced, lowering the camera. "This is going on the front page."

"You're enjoying this way too much," Ethan said.

"Of course I am. This is the best story I've covered all year." She winked. "Thanks, boys. Carry on."

By early afternoon, the square was clean. The stage had been disassembled, the trash collected, the decorations carefully packed away for next year. People dispersed gradually, heading home for late lunches and lazy Sunday afternoons.

Ethan and Caleb stayed until the end, helping Jasper load the last of the supplies into the community center's storage room. When they finally finished, the sun was high and warm, burning away the last of the morning chill.

"Beer at the tavern?" Jasper suggested. "I'm buying."

"Tempting," Caleb said, "but I think we're going to head home."

"Home," Jasper repeated, smiling. "Good word for it."

They said their goodbyes and walked back through town, taking the long way. Past the bakery, the library, the small park where children played on swings. The world felt settled, peaceful. Like everything had finally clicked into place.

When they reached the forest path leading to Caleb's cabin, Ethan paused. The trees rose around them, tall and ancient, their branches reaching toward the sky. Somewhere in the canopy, a bird sang—three clear notes, then silence.

"What?" Caleb asked.

"Nothing. Just..." Ethan turned to face him. The afternoon light filtered through the leaves, dappling Caleb's face in gold and shadow. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not giving up on me. On us. For waiting even when you shouldn't have." Ethan took his hand. "For loving me enough to say it out loud."

Caleb's expression softened. "You make it sound difficult. Loving you is the easiest thing I've ever done."

"Even when I left?"

"Even then." Caleb squeezed his hand. "Come on. Let's go home."

They walked the rest of the path in comfortable silence, boots crunching on fallen pine needles. The cabin appeared gradually through the trees, solid and welcoming. Home.

Inside, everything was as they'd left it—the coffee mugs still on the counter, the rumpled sheets visible through the loft railing, the lingering scent of breakfast and woodsmoke. But it felt different now. Less like Caleb's space that Ethan was visiting, and more like a place they were building together.

Ethan dropped his jacket on the chair and moved to the window. The afternoon light painted everything in warm gold. Through the trees, he could see the faint shimmer of ward ribbons marking the forest's edge—protective magic woven into the landscape, keeping the town safe.

Caleb came up behind him, arms sliding around his waist, chin resting on his shoulder. They stood like that for a long moment, watching the light shift and change.

"I talked to the pack council this morning," Caleb said quietly. "Before you woke up."

Ethan stiffened slightly. "And?"

"And they're happy for me. For us." Caleb's arms tightened. "There were some questions about how this changes pack dynamics, what it means for leadership if the Alpha has a partner who's not shifter. But mostly they just wanted to know if I was sure."

"Are you?"

"More than I've been about anything in my entire life." Caleb pressed a kiss to Ethan's temple. "You're pack now. Or as good as. They know that. Accept it. Some of them are even excited about it."

"Really?"

"Really. Mara's already planning a welcome ritual. Jasper wants to teach you pack protocols. And Mrs. Chen apparently told everyone she knew this would happen and has been manifesting it for years."

Ethan laughed softly. "I love this town."

"Good. Because you're stuck with it now." Caleb turned him around, hands settling on his hips. "With me. With all of this."

"Best thing I've ever been stuck with."

They kissed, slow and sweet, tasting like autumn air and promises. When they broke apart, Caleb's eyes were bright.

"So," he said. "What do you want to do with the rest of our Sunday?"

"Honestly?" Ethan glanced toward the loft. "I'd like to spend it exactly like this. Here. With you. No agenda. No expectations. Just... being."

"That sounds perfect."

They spent the afternoon wrapped up in each other—talking, touching, occasionally dozing in the warm sunlight that slanted through the windows. At some point, Caleb made sandwiches. At another, Ethan retrieved his laptop and read Caleb a draft of his new article—a piece about community and belonging, about coming home after years of wandering.

Caleb listened with his head on Ethan's shoulder, occasionally offering soft commentary. When Ethan finished, Caleb said, "It's good. Really good. You should submit it to one of the bigger outlets."

"Maybe." Ethan set the laptop aside. "Or maybe I'll just save it for the Gazette. Keep it local."

"Local works."

The light changed gradually, afternoon bleeding into evening. The temperature dropped. Caleb built a fire, coaxing flames from kindling until the cabin glowed warm and golden.

They sat together on the couch, Ethan's head on Caleb's chest, listening to the crackle of burning wood and the distant sounds of forest settling into night. Outside, the moon was rising—not full anymore, just a gentle curve of light in the darkening sky.

Ethan watched it through the window. "Do you think it's always going to be like this?"

"Like what?"

"Easy. Peaceful. Just... us."

Caleb was quiet for a moment, fingers tracing idle patterns on Ethan's shoulder. "Probably not always easy. We'll fight sometimes. Have bad days. Misunderstand each other. That's just life." His hand stilled. "But we'll work through it. Together. That's what matters."

"Together," Ethan repeated. The word felt solid, real. A promise he intended to keep.

"Always," Caleb said softly.

They sat like that until the fire burned low and the moon climbed high. At some point, Caleb suggested bed, and they climbed to the loft, shedding clothes and sliding under blankets that smelled like pine and home.

Ethan curled into Caleb's side, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. Outside, the world was dark and quiet. Inside, everything was warm.

"Hey," Caleb murmured, voice rough with approaching sleep.

"Yeah?"

"I love you."

Ethan smiled against his chest. "I love you too."

"Good." Caleb's arms tightened around him. "Just wanted to make sure you knew."

"I know." Ethan pressed a kiss to his collarbone. "I've known since we were eighteen years old. I just forgot for a while how to believe in it."

"And now?"

"Now I believe." Ethan looked up at him, finding his eyes in the darkness. "I believe in you. In us. In this life we're building. All of it."

Caleb kissed him—soft and sure and full of promise. When they broke apart, he said, "Sleep. Tomorrow we'll start figuring out logistics. Moving your things. Making space. Building something permanent."

"Sounds good."

"It does, doesn't it?"

Ethan closed his eyes, breathing in pine and woodsmoke and the warm scent of Caleb's skin. He felt settled. Grounded. Like every choice he'd made, every wrong turn and stumbling return, had been leading him exactly here—to this cabin, this man, this moment.

Home. After all these years of searching.

He was finally, impossibly home.

---

In the morning, Ethan woke early. The sun hadn't quite risen, leaving the world caught in that soft blue space between night and day. Caleb was still asleep beside him, face peaceful, one arm thrown over his head.

Ethan slipped from bed carefully, pulling on sweatpants and the borrowed flannel shirt. He padded down from the loft, moving quietly across the cabin to the door.

Outside, the air was cool and clean, carrying the scent of morning dew and pine. Mist clung to the ground, swirling gently around his bare feet. The sky was lightening gradually—pink and gold bleeding into the blue.

And there, still visible in the morning sky, was the moon.

Just a ghost now, pale and translucent, but present. Hanging above the trees like a memory of magic, a reminder of everything that had brought them here.

Ethan stood on the porch, arms wrapped around himself, watching the light change. The town below was still asleep. The forest breathed quiet and steady. The world felt new.

He heard the door open behind him, felt Caleb's presence before his warmth pressed against Ethan's back. Arms came around his waist, solid and sure.

"Morning," Caleb murmured against his ear.

"Morning." Ethan leaned back into him. "Look."

Caleb followed his gaze to the fading moon. "It's still there."

"Yeah." Ethan watched it hanging in the lightening sky—pale and perfect, slowly dissolving into daylight. "Beautiful."

"It is." But Caleb's voice suggested he wasn't looking at the moon anymore.

Ethan turned in his arms, finding his face. Caleb's eyes were soft, unguarded, reflecting the dawn. He looked happy. Content. Like a man who'd finally stopped carrying the weight of the world alone.

"Thank you," Ethan said.

"For what?"

"For this. For everything. For being patient. For loving me. For giving us another chance."

Caleb smiled and caught his hand, threading their fingers together. "It's not another chance. It's just... the right time. Finally."

The sun crested the ridge, spilling light across the valley. The moon faded further, becoming translucent, then invisible. But its presence lingered—in the steady glow of the ward ribbons, in the peace that settled over the town, in the warmth between them.

They stood together, watching the day begin, hands linked. Two people who'd spent years running from truth, from love, from home. Two people who'd finally stopped running.

The story wasn't ending. It was just beginning—in the quiet morning light, in the space between one breath and the next, in the simple fact of choosing each other.

Again and again and again.

For as long as the moon rose and the seasons turned and the magic held.

For forever, if they were lucky.

And standing there, Caleb's hand warm in his, the smell of coffee drifting from the cabin behind them, Ethan thought they just might be.
