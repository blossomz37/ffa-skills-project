# Chapter 8 – Storm Signs

The first drops hit the rusted dome before either of them dared to say what they really came for.

Caleb felt them—cold pinpricks on his neck, soaking into the collar of his flannel—and knew they should turn back. Should head down the winding path before the trail turned to mud and the sky opened fully. But Ethan was ahead of him on the narrow trail, hands in his jacket pockets, shoulders squared against the rising wind, and Caleb couldn't quite make himself call out the warning.

Not yet. Not when they'd only just started walking.

The afternoon had begun innocently enough. Ethan had texted around noon: *Any hiking recommendations? Need to clear my head and maybe get some atmospheric photos for the article.*

Caleb had suggested the old observatory hill. Abandoned since the seventies, the trail was overgrown but still passable, and the view from the clearing was worth the climb. He'd offered to guide, and Ethan had accepted with an ease that felt both natural and terrifying.

They'd met at the trailhead just after two. Ethan had shown up with a camera bag slung over one shoulder and that determined expression Caleb remembered from their teenage years—the look that meant he'd already decided on something and would see it through regardless of logic or weather patterns.

"You know there's a storm coming, right?" Caleb had said by way of greeting.

"I checked the forecast. We have at least two hours before it hits."

"Forecasts lie in these hills."

"Then I guess I better have a good guide." Ethan had grinned at him, all challenge and charm. "You are a good guide, right?"

"Best in Maple Hollow."

"That's not saying much. Population what, three hundred?"

"Three hundred and forty-seven. And I'll have you know I've never lost anyone on this trail."

"There's a first time for everything."

"Not today there isn't." Caleb had started up the trail, smiling despite himself. "Come on, city boy. Try to keep up."

"I grew up here, remember? I know these trails."

"Knew. Past tense. A lot changes in twelve years."

"Not the important things," Ethan had said quietly, and something in his voice made Caleb glance back. But Ethan was just adjusting his camera strap, face neutral, and the moment passed.

Now, two miles up and half an hour into the hike, the sky had darkened from pale gray to bruised purple. The wind carried the scent of rain-soaked earth and distant lightning—ozone and iron, sharp enough to taste. The temperature had dropped at least ten degrees in the last twenty minutes. Caleb's wolf could feel the pressure change, the electricity building in the air.

The forest around them had gone quiet—no birds, no small creatures rustling through underbrush. Just wind in the leaves and their footsteps on the packed earth trail. Even the usual insect hum had ceased, as if everything with sense had already found shelter.

"We should probably head back," Caleb said finally, raising his voice over the wind.

Ethan glanced over his shoulder, grinning despite the weather. "Five more minutes. I want to see the observatory up close."

"It's going to pour."

"Then we'll get wet." Ethan's smile was reckless, bright. "Come on, Caleb. Live a little."

Caleb followed because he'd never been able to say no to that smile. Twelve years ago, it had been the same—Ethan pushing for late-night runs through the forest, for skinny-dipping in the river after midnight, for every small rebellion that made Caleb's carefully controlled world feel wider, wilder.

The trail steepened. Leaves swirled around their feet, pulled loose by the wind. Above them, branches creaked and swayed, and the air grew heavier with moisture. Caleb could taste the storm now—metallic and electric on his tongue. His wolf was alert, restless, aware of the weather in ways that went beyond human senses.

"So tell me about the observatory," Ethan said, pausing to frame a shot of the trail winding upward through darkening trees. "When did it close?"

"Nineteen seventy-six. Funding dried up and the university that ran it couldn't justify keeping it staffed."

"And they just left it here? Abandoned?"

"Not quite. There were talks about converting it into a museum, then a youth center, then about a dozen other things that never panned out. Eventually everyone just forgot about it." Caleb watched Ethan take another photo, this one of the way light filtered through storm clouds to illuminate patches of forest in eerie gold. "The pack keeps an eye on it. Make sure kids don't get hurt exploring, that kind of thing."

"Have you been up here recently?"

"Not in a few years. Why?"

"Just wondering if you brought all your dates here." Ethan's tone was light, teasing, but there was something underneath it. A question he wasn't quite asking.

"No dates," Caleb said. "Just you."

Ethan's finger hesitated on the shutter button. He lowered the camera slowly, turned to look at Caleb. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

The wind gusted between them, carrying the first scattered drops of rain. Ethan's hair lifted, fell back across his forehead. His eyes were dark, searching.

"We should keep moving," Caleb said before the moment could stretch too long. "Unless you want to explain to Ruby why I let you drown on my watch."

"Ruby would absolutely blame you."

"Which is why we're not drowning."

Ethan laughed and started climbing again. "So no dates. What about—" He paused, seemed to reconsider. "Never mind."

"What?"

"Nothing. Forget I said anything."

"Ethan."

"It's not—look, it's none of my business what you've been doing for the last twelve years. Who you've been with. That's—we weren't together, you don't owe me explanations."

Caleb caught his arm, stopping him on the trail. "Ask."

"I don't—"

"Ask me what you want to know."

Ethan met his eyes. "Have there been others? Since I left?"

"Some." Caleb kept his voice even, honest. "Nothing serious. Nothing that lasted more than a few months."

"Why not?"

The question hung between them. Caleb could lie, could deflect, could say something about pack responsibilities or bad timing. But they'd promised themselves honesty.

"Because they weren't you," he said simply.

Ethan's breath caught. Thunder rumbled in the distance, and Caleb felt it vibrate through the ground beneath his feet.

Ethan stumbled once on exposed roots, caught himself with a laugh. "I'm blaming you if I eat dirt."

"You're the one who insisted on 'five more minutes.'"

"And you're the one who agreed." Ethan shot him a look over his shoulder—teasing, warm. "You always were bad at saying no to me."

The words landed harder than they should have. Because they were true. Even now, after twelve years and all the reasons they'd had to stay apart, Caleb couldn't quite manage the distance that would've been safer. Smarter.

"That's not a weakness," Caleb said.

"No?"

"No. It's just—" He stopped, searched for words. "You make things feel possible. Always have. Even when they probably shouldn't."

Ethan slowed, turned to face him properly on the narrow trail. Rain was falling steadily now, not quite a downpour but enough to soak through clothes. His hair was plastered to his forehead, dark with water. "Things like what?"

"Like this." Caleb gestured between them. "Like us talking again. Being friends again. Like maybe there's a version of this that doesn't end badly."

"You think we'll end badly?"

"I think we already did once."

"And if I said I want to try not to? This time?"

Thunder cracked overhead, loud enough that they both flinched. The sky opened fully then, rain coming down in sheets. Caleb grabbed Ethan's hand without thinking.

"Talk later," he said. "Run now."

They reached the clearing just as the rain began in earnest. The observatory loomed ahead—a squat concrete building with a rusted dome half-collapsed on one side. Ivy crawled up the walls. Graffiti marked the entrance in faded spray paint. It looked exactly as Caleb remembered: abandoned, haunted, beautiful in its decay.

"Wow." Ethan stopped at the edge of the clearing, rain already darkening his hair. "This is—"

Thunder cracked overhead, close enough that they both flinched.

"Inside," Caleb said, already moving. "Now."

They ran for the observatory entrance. The door hung half off its hinges, and Caleb shoved it open with his shoulder, ushering Ethan through before following. The space inside was dim, musty, smelling of mildew and old wood. Rain pounded against the dome overhead, echoing through the empty chamber.

Ethan shook water from his hair, laughing breathlessly. "Okay. Maybe you were right about heading back."

"First time for everything."

"Don't get used to it." Ethan turned in a slow circle, taking in the space. Broken equipment lined the walls—old telescopes, filing cabinets with drawers hanging open, a desk covered in leaves and debris. "This place is incredible."

Caleb watched him instead of the room. Watched the way Ethan's eyes lit up as he explored, the way his hand reached out to touch everything—rust and rot and abandonment transformed into wonder under his attention.

"We used to come here," Caleb said before he could stop himself. "When we were kids. The pack, I mean. Before it was condemned."

Ethan glanced back at him. "Yeah?"

"Summer nights, mostly. We'd sneak up here after dark, pretend we were astronomers mapping constellations." Caleb moved further into the room, his boots scuffing against debris. "Your mom brought you once. You were maybe fourteen? You spent the whole night asking questions about the stars."

"I don't remember that."

"You wouldn't. You were too busy lecturing everyone about light pollution and planetary orbits." Caleb smiled despite himself. "Ruby called you 'Professor' for weeks after."

"Oh god." Ethan groaned, but he was smiling too. "I was such a nerd."

"You were smart. Still are."

"Smart enough to know we should've turned back twenty minutes ago."

"But not smart enough to actually do it."

"Clearly." Ethan moved to one of the broken windows, peering out at the storm. Rain sheeted down in heavy curtains, turning the forest into a blur of gray and green. Lightning flashed, illuminating the clearing in stark white before darkness returned. "Think it'll pass soon?"

"Not for a while." Caleb came to stand beside him, close enough that their shoulders nearly touched. "We're stuck here until it eases up."

"Could be worse places to be stuck."

"Could be drier places."

Ethan laughed, and the sound echoed strangely in the empty chamber. "You're the one who suggested hiking in October."

"I suggested hiking. You're the one who insisted on continuing when the sky turned black."

"Details." Ethan turned to face him, still smiling. "Admit it—you're having fun."

Caleb met his eyes. "Maybe."

"Definitely." Ethan's smile softened into something gentler, more serious. "Thanks for bringing me up here. Even if we are now trapped in a possibly haunted observatory during a storm."

"It's not haunted."

"How do you know?"

"Because I've been coming here for twenty years and nothing's ever tried to kill me."

"Yet," Ethan said ominously, and Caleb couldn't help but laugh.

The rain continued, steady and relentless. Thunder rumbled—distant now, moving east. They stood together at the window, watching the storm transform the forest into something primordial and wild.

"Can I ask you something?" Ethan said after a while, his voice quieter now.

Caleb tensed slightly. "Sure."

"Why didn't you call? After I left."

The question shouldn't have surprised him. They'd been circling it for days—this unspoken weight between them, this history neither of them had properly addressed. But hearing it asked so directly, so simply, still felt like stepping off solid ground.

"You told me not to," Caleb said carefully.

"No, I told you we should take a break. That I needed space to figure things out." Ethan's gaze was steady, unflinching. "I didn't say don't ever contact me again."

"It felt like that's what you meant."

"Maybe it was." Ethan looked away, back toward the rain. "I don't know. I was twenty, Caleb. I was terrified and confused and so angry at everything—this town, my family, the pack politics, myself. I needed to leave or I was going to suffocate."

"I know."

"Do you? Because from where I was standing, you seemed relieved when I said I was going. Like you'd been waiting for an excuse to end things."

Caleb's chest tightened. "That's not—"

"You let me think leaving was what you wanted."

The words hung between them, sharp and accusatory. Not cruel, but honest in a way that cut deeper than anger.

"I thought it would hurt less," Caleb said finally. "If you believed that."

Ethan turned to face him fully. "For who? You or me?"

"Both of us." Caleb forced himself to hold Ethan's gaze. "You were leaving either way. I couldn't—" He stopped, breathed. "I couldn't be the reason you stayed when staying was killing you."

"So you just let me go."

"What else was I supposed to do?" The words came out rougher than intended. "You were drowning here, Ethan. The pack politics, the expectations, the way everyone watched us like we were some kind of symbol of supernatural integration instead of just two people trying to figure things out. You needed out, and I—" He swallowed. "I needed you to be okay more than I needed you to stay."

Ethan stared at him. Something complicated moved across his face—anger giving way to surprise, then softening into something that looked like grief.

"I thought you didn't care," he said quietly.

"I cared." Caleb's voice was rough. "I cared so much it scared me. But caring wasn't enough to make you happy here."

"You don't know that."

"Yes, I do. You were miserable, Ethan. You stopped writing, stopped exploring, stopped doing all the things that made you *you*. You'd sit at pack gatherings with this smile that never reached your eyes, and I'd watch you disappear a little more each time." Caleb's hands clenched at his sides. "Staying would've destroyed you eventually. Maybe not all at once, but slowly. Death by a thousand small compromises until there was nothing left of the person you were supposed to become."

"And letting me think you didn't want me? That didn't destroy anything?"

Caleb looked away because he couldn't bear the hurt in Ethan's eyes. "It destroyed me," he admitted. "But at least you got out."

Silence fell between them, heavy and loaded. Outside, the rain continued its steady percussion against the dome. Inside, the air felt thick, charged with more than just the storm.

"God, Caleb." Ethan's voice was barely above a whisper. "You can't just—you can't say things like that and expect me to—" He stopped, ran a hand through his damp hair. "Do you know how many times I almost called? How many times I stood in my apartment in Chicago and thought about coming back?"

"Why didn't you?"

"Because I thought you'd moved on. I thought—" Ethan laughed, but it sounded pained. "I convinced myself you were better off without me. That I'd been a distraction from your pack responsibilities, and leaving had freed you up to be the Alpha everyone needed. I told myself it was better this way, cleaner, that we'd both find people who fit better into our lives." He met Caleb's eyes. "But I never did. Find someone, I mean. Not really. There were dates, a few relationships that limped along for a while before we both admitted we were just going through motions. But no one—" His voice caught. "No one made me feel the way you did. The way you still do."

"Ethan—"

"No, let me finish. Please." Ethan took a breath. "I thought coming back would be hard. I thought seeing you again would hurt, or that we'd be awkward strangers, or that too much time had passed and we'd have nothing left to say to each other. But instead—" He laughed softly, helplessly. "Instead it feels like coming home. Like the last twelve years were just this long detour and I'm finally back where I'm supposed to be. And that terrifies me, Caleb, because I still don't have answers. I still don't know what I'm doing with my life or where I belong or if I can make this work long-term. But I know—" His voice steadied. "I know I don't want to leave again without at least trying."

"Trying what?"

"This. Us. Whatever this is or could be."

"I was never better without you."

The confession hung in the air between them.

Ethan took a step closer. Then another. Until they were standing inches apart, the space between them alive with everything unsaid over twelve years.

"I'm still figuring things out," Ethan said. "My life, my career, what I want versus what I'm supposed to want. I don't have answers, Caleb. I don't know if I'm staying or going or what happens after the festival ends."

"I know."

"And that's okay with you?"

"No." Caleb met his eyes. "It terrifies me. But I'd rather have you here, uncertain and complicated and figuring things out, than not have you at all. I've had twelve years without you, Ethan. Twelve years of pretending I was fine, that I didn't think about you every time someone laughed a certain way or asked too many questions or looked at the world like it was full of stories waiting to be told. I don't want another twelve years of that. Even if what we have now is temporary, even if you leave again—at least I'll have this. The truth, finally. Us, honestly trying."

Ethan's breath caught. "That's—"

Thunder cracked overhead, closer than before. They both jumped, then laughed—startled, breathless. The tension between them shifted, eased slightly, transmuted into something that felt less like confrontation and more like connection.

"We should probably find somewhere drier to stand," Caleb said, even though he made no move to step away.

"Probably."

Neither of them moved.

Lightning flashed again, illuminating Ethan's face in stark relief—dark eyes, sharp cheekbones, lips slightly parted. Caleb's wolf stirred, restless and wanting. The moon wasn't full for another week, but the storm had his instincts heightened, everything sharpened and electric.

"Caleb," Ethan said softly.

"Yeah?"

"I'm glad we're talking about this. Finally."

"Me too."

"But if we keep standing here looking at each other like this, I'm going to do something stupid."

"Like what?"

Ethan's smile was crooked, vulnerable. "Like kiss you."

Caleb's heart kicked hard against his ribs. "That would be stupid?"

"Probably. I meanâ€"we just had this whole conversation about me not knowing what I want, about things being complicated and uncertain—"

"Ethan."

"—and kissing you would just make everything more complicated, and we should probably be responsible adults who think things through instead of acting on impulse—"

"Ethan."

He stopped talking, looked up at Caleb with wide eyes.

"Shut up," Caleb said gently.

Then he closed the distance between them and kissed him.

It wasn't careful. Wasn't tentative or gentle or any of the things a first kiss probably should've been after twelve years apart. It was desperate and hungry, twelve years of longing compressed into a single point of contact. Ethan made a sound—startled, pleased—and then his hands were in Caleb's hair, pulling him closer, and Caleb's hands found Ethan's hips, gripping hard enough to leave marks.

They kissed like the storm outside—urgent and wild and inevitable. Like something that had been building for days and could only break one way.

When they finally pulled apart, both breathing hard, Ethan laughed shakily. "Okay. That was—"

Thunder crashed directly overhead, so loud it shook the building. They both flinched, and Caleb instinctively pulled Ethan closer, protective.

"We should really find better shelter," he said against Ethan's hair.

"Like where?"

"There's a supply room in back. If the roof's still intact, it'll be drier than here."

"Lead the way."

They made their way through the debris-strewn main chamber, Caleb's hand finding Ethan's in the dimness. The contact felt monumental—fingers linking, palms pressing together, skin warm despite the chill. Caleb's wolf hummed with satisfaction at the touch, at having Ethan close and willing and *here*.

The supply room door was stuck, but Caleb shouldered it open easily. Inside was smaller, darker, but blessedly dry. A few old crates, some moth-eaten blankets in a corner, a dusty lantern that looked like it hadn't been lit in decades. The window was small and grimy, filtering what little light remained into something gray and diffuse.

"Cozy," Ethan said, looking around.

"Better than drowning."

"Fair point."

Lightning flashed through the small window, and in that brief illumination Caleb saw Ethan clearly—hair dark with rain, jacket soaked through, lips still swollen from kissing. He looked exactly like he had at twenty: beautiful and reckless and entirely too much for Caleb's carefully maintained composure. But there was something else now too, something harder-won and more certain. The boy had become a man who knew his own worth, who could name what he wanted even when it scared him.

"Come here," Caleb said.

Ethan went to him without hesitation. They stood together in the near-darkness, bodies aligned from chest to knee. Caleb could feel Ethan shivering—whether from cold or adrenaline or something else entirely, he wasn't sure. His wolf wanted to wrap around him, to share warmth and safety, to mark him as pack, as *mine*.

"Your jacket's soaked," Caleb said.

"So's yours."

"I run warmer than you."

"Shifter perks?"

"Something like that." Caleb reached for the zipper of Ethan's jacket. "May I?"

"Yeah."

He unzipped it slowly, pushed it off Ethan's shoulders. The shirt underneath was damp but not drenched, clinging to Ethan's frame in ways that made Caleb's mouth go dry. He could see the rapid rise and fall of Ethan's breathing, could smell rain and skin and the faint cedar scent of his shampoo. Every sense was heightened, focused entirely on the man in front of him.

Caleb hesitated, then shrugged out of his own flannel overshirt, leaving just his thermal underneath. He draped the flannel over Ethan's shoulders, and the sight of it—his clothes on Ethan's body, warm from his own skin—did something to him. Made his wolf rumble with possessive satisfaction.

"You don't have to—"

"I want to." Caleb pulled it closed around him, his hands resting on Ethan's chest. He could feel Ethan's heartbeat through the fabric—fast, strong, steady. "Better?"

"Yeah." Ethan's voice was quiet. "Thanks."

They stood like that for a long moment, the storm raging outside their small shelter. Thunder rumbled continuously now, a bass note that Caleb felt in his bones. His wolf was restless, aware of Ethan in ways that went beyond human sensation—his heartbeat, his scent, the warmth of his skin through layers of fabric, the way his pupils had dilated in the low light, the slight tremor in his hands.

"So," Ethan said eventually. "We kissed."

"We did."

"Was it—" He paused. "Was it what you expected?"

"I stopped letting myself expect it a long time ago." Caleb's thumbs moved absently against Ethan's chest, feeling the ridge of his collarbones through shirt and flannel. "Safer that way."

"But now that it happened?"

Caleb considered. "Better," he said honestly. "And more terrifying."

"Yeah." Ethan's hands came up to rest on Caleb's forearms. "Same."

"What do we do now?"

"I don't know." Ethan looked up at him. "What do you want to do?"

What Caleb wanted was to kiss him again. To keep kissing him until the storm passed and the world made sense again. To carry him home and spend the rest of the night learning what had changed and what had stayed the same over twelve years apart. He wanted to map every scar and new line on Ethan's skin, wanted to hear what sounds he made now, wanted to know if he still sighed when kissed behind the ear or if that had changed too.

But wanting wasn't the same as wise. And Ethan had been clear—he didn't have answers, didn't know if he was staying, wasn't sure what he wanted beyond this moment.

"I want," Caleb said carefully, "to not rush this. To do it right this time."

"What does 'right' look like?"

"Honest. Patient. No more pretending things are simple when they're not." He smoothed the flannel over Ethan's shoulders. "I want you, Ethan. Have since we were teenagers. But I also want you to be sure. To know what you're choosing and why."

"And if I'm not sure yet?"

"Then we take it slow. We talk, we spend time together, we figure things out as we go." Caleb managed a smile. "We have time. The festival runs another week. No reason to make everything more complicated by rushing."

Ethan was quiet for a moment. Then: "That's very reasonable."

"Is it?"

"Annoyingly so." Ethan's smile was crooked. "I was kind of hoping you'd be more impulsive."

"I kissed you in an abandoned observatory during a thunderstorm. How much more impulsive do you want?"

"Fair point." Ethan laughed softly. "Okay. Slow. Honest. No rushing." He paused. "But we can still—I mean, we're not pretending this didn't happen, right?"

"No. We're definitely not pretending that." Caleb's thumb traced Ethan's jaw. "I'm just saying we don't have to figure everything out tonight."

"Just some things?"

"Just some things."

"Like whether you're going to kiss me again?"

Caleb's smile was slow, warm. "That's not really a question."

"No?"

"No. I'm absolutely going to kiss you again."

"When?"

"When you're ready." Caleb leaned down, pressed his forehead to Ethan's. "When we're both sure it's what we want and not just adrenaline or nostalgia or fear of what happens if we don't."

"That's a lot of criteria."

"Is it?"

Ethan's hands slid up to cup Caleb's face. "Kiss me again now," he said quietly. "Not because of adrenaline or nostalgia. Because I want you to, and you want to, and sometimes that's enough."

Caleb searched his face. Found nothing but honesty and heat and something that looked remarkably like trust.

"Yeah," he said. "Sometimes that's enough."

This kiss was different—slower, deeper, less desperate and more deliberate. They took their time learning each other again, cataloging what was familiar and what was new. Ethan still fit perfectly against him, still made small pleased sounds when Caleb's hands found his hips. But his kiss was different now—more confident, more demanding. He knew what he wanted and wasn't afraid to take it, to give it.

Caleb felt Ethan's hands slide under his thermal, fingers finding skin. The touch made him gasp against Ethan's mouth, made his wolf surge forward with want. Ethan's hands were cool from the rain, but they warmed quickly against Caleb's heated skin, mapping the planes of his back with careful attention.

"Is this okay?" Ethan murmured against his lips.

"More than okay."

"Good." Ethan pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "Because I've thought about this. About touching you again. About—" He stopped, seemed to reconsider how much to admit.

"About what?"

"Everything." Ethan's smile was crooked, vulnerable. "About what you'd feel like now, whether you'd still kiss the same way, whether your skin would still be this warm. Whether you'd still make that sound when I—" He pressed his thumb against the pulse point in Caleb's throat, and Caleb's breath hitched involuntarily. "Yeah. That sound."

"You remember that?"

"I remember everything about you, Caleb. That's the problem. That's always been the problem."

They kissed again, and this time it was hungrier, more urgent. Caleb backed Ethan against the wall, careful even in his desperation, and Ethan went willingly, eagerly. His hands were in Caleb's hair now, tugging gently, and Caleb groaned into his mouth.

The storm raged outside, but inside their small shelter the world had narrowed to this—skin and breath and the slide of lips and hands. Caleb could feel Ethan everywhere: the press of his chest, the grip of his fingers, the way his hips canted forward seeking friction. It was overwhelming and not enough all at once.

When they finally pulled apart this time, both breathing hard, Ethan was smiling. "Okay. That was—"

"Better than the first?"

"Different. Both good." He rested his head against Caleb's chest. "We're really doing this."

"Looks like it."

"Are you scared?"

"Terrified."

"Me too." Ethan's arms came around Caleb's waist, pulling him closer. "But also kind of excited?"

"Yeah. That too."

They stood together in the small room, rain drumming overhead, while the storm slowly moved east. Caleb held him and let himself feel it—the weight of Ethan in his arms, the rightness of having him close again, the possibility that maybe this time they could make it work. Maybe this time they were old enough, wise enough, brave enough to do it right.

"The rain's easing," Ethan said after a while.

"Little bit."

"Should we head back?"

"Probably should."

Neither of them moved.

"Five more minutes?" Ethan asked.

Caleb smiled against his hair. "Five more minutes."

They stayed like that—wrapped together in the dimness, flannel and warmth and the lingering scent of rain—while the storm broke apart and the sky began its slow return to gray-blue evening light.

When they finally did make their way down the trail, the forest was transformed. Everything dripped and gleamed. The air smelled clean and sharp—pine and wet earth and that particular scent of rain-washed autumn. Puddles reflected the emerging sky, turning the trail into a mirror of twilight colors. The temperature had dropped further, but Caleb barely felt it, his blood still running hot from kissing.

They walked close together, not quite touching but aware of each other in ways that felt new and old at once. Caleb could hear every shift in Ethan's breathing, could smell the rain in his hair and the lingering traces of his own scent from the flannel still wrapped around Ethan's shoulders.

"So," Ethan said after they'd descended in comfortable silence for several minutes. "What happens now? Do we tell people?"

"About?"

"Us. This. Whatever we're calling it."

Caleb considered. "What do you want to call it?"

"I don't know. 'Cautiously optimistic rekindling of a twelve-year-old relationship' doesn't exactly roll off the tongue."

"How about 'trying again'?"

"Simple."

"I like simple."

"Says the Alpha of a supernatural pack during harvest moon festival season."

Caleb laughed despite himself. "Fair point. But this—" He gestured between them. "This gets to be simple. Everything else can be complicated."

"Can it though? Be simple?" Ethan's voice was thoughtful, not challenging. "The last time we tried, everything got tangled up in pack politics and expectations and me not knowing how to exist in this world without losing myself. What makes this time different?"

"We're different. Older. We've both lived other lives, learned things about ourselves." Caleb paused on the trail, turned to face Ethan properly. "And I think—I hope—we're both better at asking for what we need instead of assuming the other person can read our minds."

"I was terrible at that," Ethan admitted. "Asking for things. I'd just get quietly resentful and expect you to notice."

"And I was terrible at seeing past what I thought you needed to what you actually needed."

"So we're both reformed terrible communicators?"

"Working on it, anyway."

Ethan smiled. "I can work with that." Halfway down, Ethan slipped on wet leaves and Caleb caught him—hand around his wrist, steadying him. The touch was electric, immediate. Caleb could feel Ethan's pulse racing under his fingertips, could see the way his pupils dilated at the contact.

"Thanks," Ethan said, but he didn't pull away.

Caleb didn't let go right away either. Just held him there, thumb pressed against his pulse point, feeling the steady drum of Ethan's heartbeat. It was faster than resting, but not panicked. Just alive, present, here.

"Anytime," he said.

They stood like that for a long moment—hands linked, the forest breathing around them, evening settling over the trees like a held breath. Then Ethan smiled, squeezed Caleb's wrist gently, and tugged him forward down the trail.

The rest of the descent passed in companionable quiet, punctuated by occasional observations about the storm's aftermath or Ethan stopping to photograph the way light filtered through breaking clouds. Each time he paused, Caleb found himself watching him instead of the view—the concentration on his face as he framed a shot, the way his tongue peeked out slightly when he was focused, the unconscious grace of his movements.

"You're staring," Ethan said without looking up from his camera.

"How do you know?"

"I can feel it." He lowered the camera, met Caleb's eyes. "You always stared when you thought I wasn't looking."

"You always knew anyway."

"Yeah." Ethan's smile was soft. "I kind of liked it."

"Past tense?"

"Present tense. I still like it."

They continued down, the trail growing less steep as they approached the base of the hill. Lights from town were visible now through the trees—warm and welcoming, promising hot showers and dry clothes and whatever came next.

Rain-soaked and breathless, they made their way back toward town as dusk settled over Maple Hollow. Caleb's flannel was still draped over Ethan's shoulders. Neither of them mentioned giving it back.

When they reached the trailhead, Ethan finally released Caleb's wrist. But his fingers lingered for just a moment longer than necessary—a small promise, a quiet acknowledgment that something between them had shifted.

"See you tomorrow?" Ethan asked.

"Tomorrow," Caleb confirmed.

They separated then, walking in different directions. But when Caleb glanced back, he found Ethan looking back too.

They both smiled.

And Caleb knew—whatever came next, whatever complications or uncertainties lay ahead—this was worth it. Ethan was worth it.

The storm had passed, but its electricity lingered in Caleb's veins long after he'd returned home. He sat on his porch as night fell fully, still damp from the rain, still feeling the ghost of Ethan's hands in his hair. His flannel was gone, given to Ethan. His wolf was restless, satisfied and hungry in equal measure, prowling beneath his skin.

The moon was rising through breaking clouds—not quite full, but close enough that Caleb could feel its pull in his blood. Another week until the Harvest Moon reached its peak. Another week of this careful dance with Ethan, of wanting and waiting and wondering if they could really make this work.

He thought about the way Ethan had kissed him in the observatory—fierce and certain and unafraid. Thought about the confessions they'd traded in the darkness, the honesty that had felt like stepping off a cliff. Twelve years of silence, broken. Twelve years of careful distance, collapsed into hours.

His phone buzzed. Ruby: *Storm bring anything interesting?*

Caleb smiled despite himself. Typed back: *You could say that.*

*Details?*

*Tomorrow.*

*Tease. But also I saw you two walking back together and Ethan was wearing your flannel so I'm going to assume my sachets are working their magic.*

*The sachets are just herbs.*

*Uh huh. And you're just the Alpha. And Ethan's just visiting. Keep telling yourself that, Hawthorne. Some of us know better.*

He set his phone aside before Ruby could grill him further. The air smelled of rain and approaching autumn—clean and sharp and full of change. Somewhere in town, Ethan was probably transcribing interview notes or uploading photos or doing whatever journalists did when they weren't turning Caleb's carefully ordered world upside down.

Was he thinking about the kiss? About the things they'd admitted in that dusty supply room? About what came next?

Caleb hoped so. Hoped he wasn't alone in feeling like something fundamental had shifted between them, like they'd crossed some invisible threshold that couldn't be uncrossed.

His wolf stirred, pleased and possessive. Ethan had worn his flannel home. Had let Caleb hold his wrist on the trail, had kissed him like he meant it, like he wanted to mean it. Small things, maybe, but they felt monumental.

*Tomorrow*, Caleb thought. They'd see each other tomorrow. And the day after. And however many days Ethan chose to stay.

For now, that was enough. For now, he could let himself hope.

Rain-soaked and breathless, Caleb caught Ethan's wrist to steady him—and neither let go right away.

Tomorrow would bring its own complications. But tonight, Caleb let himself hope.
