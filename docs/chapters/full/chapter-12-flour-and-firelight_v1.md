Lantern light painted the crowd gold as Caleb stepped forward, heart beating like a drum beneath the music.

The Harvest Square stage had been built over three days, solid oak planks fitted together by pack members who knew how to work wood the old way—no power tools, just hands and craft and the steady rhythm of labor. Now it stood draped in ribbons the color of harvest: amber, crimson, deep gold. Lanterns hung from every post, their flames dancing behind curved glass, casting shadows that stretched and swayed with each gust of October wind. The Hollow Choir stood to one side, instruments at the ready, voices humming low in anticipation. The scent of applewood smoke mingled with roasted corn, cinnamon, and the sharper bite of pine resin from the freshly cut garlands.

And everywhere, *everywhere*, there were people.

More than Caleb had expected. More than the square was built to hold. They spilled out past the vendor stalls, lined the steps of the library, perched on benches and against storefronts. Festival goers in knit scarves and wool coats, faces flushed from cider and cold. Children clutching stick horses and painted masks, their laughter cutting through the adult conversations like bells.

Caleb had never seen the square this full. Locals packed the center, familiar faces he'd known since childhood. Pack members scattered throughout, their scents mingling with applewood smoke and roasted corn. Tourists lined the edges, cameras ready, notebooks out, drawn by rumors of something authentic in a world that had forgotten what that meant.

They were all looking at him.

Alpha. Leader. The man who kept Maple Hollow safe. The person they turned to when the moon rose too bright, when ward ribbons flickered, when the old magic surged stronger than it had in years.

Caleb felt the weight of their expectation like a physical thing pressing against his ribs. His wolf prowled beneath his skin, restless and wary. The full moon was rising—he could feel it even before he saw it, that amber glow cresting the ridge to the east, spilling light like honey over the treetops.

It made everything sharper. Brighter. More *intense*.

Including the way his chest tightened every time he caught Ethan's scent in the crowd.

Coffee and old books and rain. The smell of home, if home had ever learned how to stay.

Caleb scanned the faces until he found him. Ethan stood near the back, half-hidden behind Ruby and Mrs. Chen, arms crossed over his chest like he was holding himself together by force. His eyes were locked on Caleb with an expression that might have been hope or fear or both.

This morning's apology still echoed in Caleb's mind. *I've loved you since I was eighteen years old and too stupid to know how to stay.* Said in front of the whole town council, notebook shaking in his hands, voice raw with honesty.

Caleb hadn't known what to do with that. Still didn't. So he'd said "okay" and walked away before the ache in his chest could make him do something foolish like forgive too quickly.

But the moon didn't care about his caution. It pulled at him, made the wolf in his blood howl for closeness, for pack, for the one person who'd ever made him feel like Caleb instead of Alpha.

Mayor Vance stepped up to the microphone, his silver hair catching the lantern light. The crowd settled into expectant silence. Even the children stopped running, caught by the shift in atmosphere.

"Welcome," the mayor said, his voice carrying over the square with practiced ease, "to the one-hundred-and-forty-third Harvest Moon Festival of Maple Hollow."

Applause rippled through the crowd. Caleb stood at the edge of the stage, hands loose at his sides, trying to look calm. Controlled. The Alpha who had everything under control.

The mayor continued with the traditional welcomes, thanking volunteers, acknowledging the Hollow Choir, reminding everyone about vendor locations and safety protocols. Caleb let the words wash over him, familiar as a lullaby. He'd heard this speech every year since childhood. His father had stood where he was standing now, wearing the same mask of steady leadership, carrying the same weight.

*But Dad had Mom beside him*, Caleb thought. *Never had to stand here alone.*

The moon climbed higher. Its light touched the ribbons first, making them glow like captured fire. Then it spilled across the crowd, washing faces in amber and shadow. The ward ribbons around the square began to shimmer, responding to the lunar pull.

Caleb felt the magic surge through the ground beneath his feet. Not dangerous yet. Just... present. Awake. The way it always was during Harvest Moon, when the veil between worlds thinned and old power remembered how to breathe.

"And now," Mayor Vance was saying, "I'd like to address something that's been on many of your minds this past week."

Caleb's attention snapped back. The mayor glanced at him, a silent question in his eyes. Caleb nodded once. They'd discussed this beforehand. The article. The leaked information. The tension that had been building in town since Ethan's piece went public.

It needed to be addressed. Acknowledged. Put to rest before the festival could truly begin.

"Many of you have read Mr. Cole's article," the mayor continued. His tone was carefully neutral. "Some of you were upset by it. Others found it... illuminating. Either way, it's raised questions about our community, our traditions, and the balance we maintain between privacy and transparency."

A murmur ran through the crowd. Caleb saw heads turning, people looking for Ethan. Found him still standing in the back, shoulders tense, chin lifted like he was bracing for impact.

"Mr. Cole spoke to the town council this morning," the mayor said. "He offered an apology and an explanation. He took responsibility for his choices and their consequences. That took courage." The mayor paused, letting his words settle. "But courage alone doesn't repair trust. That takes time. It takes action. And it takes community willing to listen."

More murmurs. Caleb couldn't tell if they were agreeable or angry. The lantern light made it hard to read expressions.

"So before we begin tonight's festivities," the mayor said, "I'm opening the floor. If anyone has something to say about the article, about trust, about what it means to be part of this communityâ€"now is the time."

Silence.

Then, from somewhere in the middle of the crowd, Mrs. Chen's voice rang out clear and firm. "I have something to say."

People shifted to let her through. She was barely five feet tall but carried herself like someone twice that size. She climbed the stage steps with the authority of someone who'd taught half the town in Sunday school and wasn't about to tolerate nonsense from anyone.

"Ethan Cole," she said, not bothering with the microphone, "wrote about things that made us uncomfortable. Made us look at ourselves in ways we don't always like." She paused, surveying the crowd with sharp eyes. "Good. We *should* be uncomfortable sometimes. Means we're paying attention."

A few uncertain laughs rippled through the audience.

"But here's what I know," Mrs. Chen continued. "That boy came back here because he loves this town. Maybe loved it too much, got tangled up trying to understand it, made some mistakes in the process." She shrugged. "Who among us hasn't made mistakes when we love something so hard it scares us?"

Caleb's throat tightened. He kept his face carefully neutral, but inside, something was cracking.

"I say we listen to what he has to say," Mrs. Chen finished. "Not because we owe him anything. But because that's what community does. We listen. We decide. Together." She looked directly at Caleb. "All of us. Including you, Alpha."

Then she climbed down and disappeared back into the crowd.

The silence that followed felt like a held breath. Caleb could feel everyone waiting for his response. Pack members watching to see how their Alpha would handle this. Locals trying to gauge whether forgiveness was on the table. Tourists with their cameras ready, hoping to capture something real.

And Ethan. Ethan watching with his heart written all over his face.

Caleb stepped up to the microphone. The feedback whined briefly, then settled. He cleared his throat.

"Mrs. Chen is right," he said. His voice came out steadier than he felt. "Community means listening. Means making space for people to be wrong and learn and try again." He paused, choosing his next words carefully. "The article hurt. It exposed things that felt private. Things I wanted to keep safe."

He could see Ethan's face in the crowd, pale and strained.

"But maybe..." Caleb stopped. Started again. "Maybe keeping everything safe isn't the same as keeping it alive. Maybe some things need air to breathe. Need truth to grow."

The moon broke fully over the ridge, flooding the square with amber light. The ward ribbons flared bright, then settled to a steady glow.

"Ethan Cole came back to Maple Hollow," Caleb said, and his voice carried across the square with more steadiness than he felt, "and wrote about what he saw. The magic. The moon. The emotional surges that come with living in a place where the supernatural is part of daily life." 

He paused, gathering courage. The moon pressed against his skin, patient and insistent. *Say it*, it seemed to whisper. *Say what you've been hiding.*

He met Ethan's eyes across the crowd. Even in the lantern light, even with distance between them, Caleb could see everything written on his face. Hope. Fear. Love so naked it hurt to witness.

"He also wrote about honesty," Caleb continued, softer now. "About what happens when we stop hiding what we feel. When we let the moon pull truth to the surface and actually... listen to it."

His hands were shaking. He released the microphone stand and let them hang at his sides, visible tremors and all. No more hiding. No more pretending to be unshakable.

"I spent a lot of years being Alpha first," he said. The words felt like they were being pulled from somewhere deep, somewhere he'd kept locked and protected for too long. "Putting duty before everything else. Thinking that was what leadership meant. Control. Protection. Keeping everyone safe at the expense of..." 

He stopped. The crowd was utterly silent, barely breathing, and Caleb felt exposed in a way that had nothing to do with standing on a stage. But he'd started this. Had to finish it.

"At the expense of being honest about what I wanted," he managed. "What I felt. Who I loved."

His hands were shaking. He gripped the microphone stand to steady them.

"Ethan wrote that the moon magnifies honesty," Caleb continued. "That during Harvest Moon, people can't hide from what they're really feeling. It pulls truth to the surface whether we're ready or not."

The crowd was utterly silent now. Even the children had gone still.

"Seems the moon just proved him right," Caleb said. His voice was rough. Raw. "Because I can't stand here and pretend anymore. Can't hide behind duty or leadership or the idea that Alphas don't get to want things."

Ethan was moving through the crowd now, pushing past people, drawn forward like the moon itself was pulling him.

"I was angry about the article," Caleb said. He was speaking to Ethan now, not the crowd. "Felt exposed. Vulnerable. But underneath that... I was scared. Scared of wanting something so much and losing it again. Scared of being seen as just Caleb instead of Alpha and finding out that wasn't enough."

Ethan had reached the front of the stage. He stood there looking up, eyes bright with unshed tears.

"But I'm tired of being scared," Caleb said. The words felt like they were being torn out of him. "Tired of choosing duty over heart. Tired of pretending I don't..." He swallowed hard. "I love you. I have always loved you. And I'm sorry I wasn't brave enough to say it twelve years ago when it might have made you stay."

The crowd gasped. Someone started crying. Caleb barely heard them.

"So here's the truth," he said, quieter now but no less certain. "I want you to stay. Not because the town needs a journalist or because you owe us an apology. But because *I* need you. Because when you're here, I remember how to be more than just the person everyone depends on. Because you make me feel like being Caleb is enough."

The moonlight surged. The ribbons around the square flared brilliant gold, pulsing with the rhythm of Caleb's heartbeat. Power thrummed through the ground, ancient and alive, responding to the emotional honesty spilling out under its light.

Ethan climbed the stage steps. Slow. Careful. Like he was afraid sudden movement would break the spell.

"You're saying this in front of everyone," Ethan said. His voice shook. "You hate public displays."

"Yeah." Caleb's mouth twitched in something almost like a smile. "Well. You apologized publicly. Seemed fair to match your courage with some of my own."

"This is more than courage," Ethan said. "This is... Caleb, this is everything."

"I know."

They stood two feet apart. The space between them felt electric, charged with moonlight and magic and twelve years of unspoken want.

"I don't deserve this," Ethan whispered.

"Neither do I," Caleb said. "So I guess we're even."

The crowd was murmuring now, a low hum of conversation and emotion. Somewhere in the back, someone started clapping. Then more people joined in. Then the whole square erupted in applause and cheers and wolf-calls from the pack members who'd been waiting years for their Alpha to let himself want something.

Ethan laughed, startled and breathless. "They're cheering."

"Small town," Caleb said. "We've been gossip for decades. They're invested."

"Are you okay with that?"

Caleb reached out, slow enough that Ethan could see it coming, and took his hand. Their fingers laced together, familiar and right.

"Yeah," he said. "I think I am."

The Hollow Choir started playing. Soft at first, then building—fiddle and guitar and voices blending in the opening notes of "Harvest Home," the traditional song they sang every year at moonrise. The crowd joined in, voices lifting together in harmony.

Ethan looked down at their joined hands, then back up at Caleb. "What happens now?"

"Now?" Caleb tugged him closer. "Now we dance. We eat terrible festival food. We watch the moon rise and try not to trip over enthusiastic children. We do all the normal things people do when they're allowed to be happy."

"And after the festival?"

"After?" Caleb brought their joined hands to his chest, pressed them against his heartbeat. "After, we figure it out. Together. Without hiding. Without running. Just... us. Honestly."

"I can do honest," Ethan said. His eyes were wet but his smile was steady. "I'm good at honest now."

"I know."

The song swelled around them. The moon hung huge and amber over the ridge, spilling light like blessing over the square. The ward ribbons glowed steady now, no longer flickering with uncertain magic. Stable. Balanced.

Because honesty healed what secrets had wounded.

Because love, spoken aloud, was its own form of protection.

Caleb pulled Ethan closer. "Can I kiss you? Here? In front of everyone?"

Ethan laughed, bright and surprised. "Alpha Hawthorne, are you asking permission?"

"I'm asking if you're ready to be seen. Really seen. As mine."

The word hung between them. *Mine.* Not a claim. Not possession. Just... truth.

"I've been yours since I was eighteen," Ethan said. "Just took me twelve years to stop being afraid of it."

"Is that a yes?"

"That's a yes."

Caleb kissed him as the moon broke fully over the ridge, light spilling like forgiveness over them all. 

The crowd erupted. Not just cheering—*howling*. Pack members threw their heads back and let their wolves sing through human throats, voices rising in harmony with the Choir's music. Children squealed and jumped. Ruby was definitely crying. Mrs. Chen was clutching Mr. Okoye's arm and dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. Even Mayor Vance looked suspiciously misty.

But Caleb barely registered any of it. He was too focused on the way Ethan tasted like cinnamon and hope, the way his hands fisted in Caleb's shirt like he was afraid to let go, the way twelve years of longing finally, *finally* resolved into this: mouths meeting, breath mingling, hearts beating the same wild rhythm.

The magic in the air surged. The ward ribbons around the square blazed brilliant gold, pulsing in time with their kiss. Lantern flames leapt higher, then settled to a warm, steady glow. The ground beneath them hummed with approval, ancient power recognizing the truth in their joining, blessing it the way the land had always blessed honest love.

When they finally broke apart, breathless and smiling, their foreheads pressed together. Ethan's eyes were wet. Caleb's chest felt too full, like his heart was trying to expand beyond the boundaries of his ribs.

"That was very public," Ethan managed.

"You noticed."

"I noticed. Also, Mrs. Chen is crying. And Ruby. And I think Jasper just fainted."

"He didn't faint. He's celebrating. Very dramatically."

"Still." Ethan laughed, the sound bright and disbelieving. "God, we're a mess."

"Best kind of mess."

The mayor appeared beside them, grinning like someone who'd just won a bet. "Well. That was more eventful than my planned remarks."

Caleb didn't let go of Ethan's hand. "Sorry, Mayor."

"Don't be. This is exactly what Harvest Moon is supposed to be about. Honesty. Community. Choosing each other over fear." He clapped Caleb on the shoulder. "Your father would be proud."

Something in Caleb's chest loosened. "You think so?"

"I know so. He always said you were too hard on yourself. Too willing to carry everything alone." The mayor's expression softened. "He'd be glad you finally let someone help."

Ethan squeezed Caleb's hand. A small gesture. A promise.

*I'm here. I'm staying. You're not alone.*

The festival continued around them. Music and laughter and the smell of roasted nuts and cider. Children ran between the vendor stalls, faces painted with autumn leaves and crescent moons. Pack members moved through the crowd, relaxed now that their Alpha had released the tension they'd all been carrying.

Jasper appeared with a tray of something fried and questionable. "You two need to eat. Alpha doesn't get to pass out from low blood sugar after the most romantic public declaration this town has seen since the Miller twins got married on the solstice."

"That was different," Caleb said. "They eloped first, then had the public ceremony."

"Still romantic." Jasper thrust the tray at them. "Eat. Both of you. That's an order from your pack second."

Ethan took a piece of fried dough dusted with cinnamon sugar. "This is amazing."

"Mara made it," Jasper said. "She's got a stall by the library. You should go thank her later. She's been stress-baking since the article leaked."

"Was she angry?" Ethan asked quietly.

"She was worried. About you, mostly. And about Caleb. Figured you two were too stubborn to figure things out without intervention." Jasper grinned. "Guess she was wrong."

"Not entirely wrong," Caleb said. "Took the entire town watching to get me to admit what I was feeling."

"Whatever works." Jasper's expression turned more serious. "But for real, Alpha. I'm glad you said it. You've been carrying too much alone for too long."

"I know."

"Do you? Because that's not just about Ethan. That's about the pack. About letting us help instead of trying to protect everyone single-handedly."

Caleb sighed. "I'm working on it."

"Keep working." Jasper squeezed his shoulder, then disappeared back into the crowd.

The night wore on. Caleb and Ethan walked through the festival together, hands linked, letting themselves be seen. People stopped them every few steps—congratulations, questions, jokes about when the wedding would be.

"They're getting ahead of themselves," Ethan murmured after the fifth person asked about honeymoon plans.

"Small town," Caleb reminded him. "Give them an inch, they'll plan your entire life."

"Do you mind?"

"Mind what?"

"The questions. The assumptions. The way they're already treating us like a settled thing."

Caleb stopped walking. Turned to face Ethan fully. "Are we? A settled thing?"

Ethan's expression went soft. "I hope so. I mean, if you want that. I know we should probably take things slow, rebuild trust, not rush intoâ€""

Caleb kissed him quiet. Just a brief press of lips, tasting cinnamon and hope.

"I've waited twelve years," he said. "I'm done going slow."

"So we're doing this? Actually doing this?"

"If you're staying. If you mean it about not running."

"I mean it." Ethan said it like a vow. "I'm staying. I'll get a job at the Gazette, help with the pack however you need me, be the journalist who writes about Maple Hollow with love instead of distance. But mostly?" He stepped closer, until their foreheads touched. "Mostly I just want to be with you. However that looks."

The moon pulsed overhead, approving.

The ward ribbons glowed steady and bright.

The pack magic hummed content.

"Then we're doing this," Caleb said. "Publicly. Messily. Honestly."

"Best way to do anything," Ethan agreed.

They kept walking. The festival swirled around them—music and light and laughter. Maple Hollow at its best, celebrating the harvest and the moon and the old magic that made everything sharper.

Ruby found them near the Choir's stage, her smile wide and smug. "Told you. Told you he'd say it."

"You bet on this?" Caleb asked.

"Please. The whole town bet on this. Mrs. Chen had a pool going. I won fifty bucks when you kissed him in front of everyone."

Ethan laughed. "Unbelievable."

"Believable," Ruby corrected. "Very, very believable. You two have been circling each other like planets for twelve years. We've all been waiting for gravity to finally win."

"Gravity or the full moon?" Caleb asked.

"Same thing in Maple Hollow." Ruby hugged Ethan, quick and fierce. "I'm glad you stayed."

"Me too."

She punched his arm lightly. "Don't screw it up this time."

"I won't."

"Good. Because I'm not above haunting you if you hurt my Alpha again."

"Noted."

Ruby disappeared into the crowd, probably to collect her winnings from Mrs. Chen.

The night deepened. The moon rose higher, painting everything silver-gold. The Choir sang ballads and dance tunes. Couples spun in the square, laughing and breathless. Children dozed on parents' shoulders, sticky with sugar and contentment.

And through it all, Caleb felt something he hadn't felt in years.

Peace.

Not the carefully constructed calm he wore as Alpha. Not the controlled mask he showed the world. But real, genuine peace. The kind that came from being honest. From letting people see you and choosing not to hide.

Ethan leaned against his shoulder as they watched the dancing. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being brave enough to say it. I know it wasn't easy."

"It wasn't," Caleb admitted. "But it was right. And I'm tired of choosing easy over right."

"Me too."

They stood together as the festival swirled around them, two people who'd spent years running from the same thing, finally standing still long enough to let it catch them.

Love. Truth. Home.

The moon blessed them with light.

The town blessed them with acceptance.

And Caleb blessed himself with the permission to want something that wasn't duty or responsibility or protection.

Permission to want joy. And Ethan. And a future built on honesty instead of fear.

The Choir began the closing song, voices lifting in harmony on "Silver Road Home"—the traditional ending to every festival, a reminder that no matter how far you wandered, Maple Hollow would always welcome you back.

Ethan sang along, voice rough but steady. Caleb listened, watching the way moonlight caught in his hair, turned his eyes silver and soft.

*This*, he thought. *This is what I was so afraid of losing.*

But standing here, hand in hand with the person he loved, surrounded by community and magic and the ancient rhythm of the harvest moon, Caleb realized something:

The fear had never been about losing Ethan.

It had been about losing himself.

About becoming so consumed by duty that there was nothing left of Caleb beneath the Alpha.

But Ethan saw him. Had always seen him. Even when Caleb had forgotten how to see himself.

The song ended. The crowd began to disperse, heading home or to after-parties or to wander the lantern-lit streets, still buzzing with festival magic.

Caleb turned to Ethan. "Come home with me?"

Ethan's eyes widened. "Tonight?"

"Tonight. Tomorrow. Every night after if you want." Caleb brought their joined hands to his lips, kissed Ethan's knuckles. "I don't want to waste any more time pretending I can sleep without you."

"That's..." Ethan's voice cracked. "That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me."

"Just wait," Caleb promised. "I've got twelve years of things I should have said. Might take a while to get through them all."

"I've got time."

"Good."

They walked away from the square together, leaving the festival behind. The moon followed them, spilling light through the trees, painting the path silver. Ward ribbons glowed softly as they passed, recognizing the Alpha and his chosen, blessing their passage.

Caleb's cabin sat at the edge of town, tucked among pines, close enough to respond if the pack needed him but far enough to feel like sanctuary. Ethan had been here before, years ago, when they were younger and everything felt simultaneously infinite and impossibly fragile. But tonight it felt different.

Like coming home after a long journey.

Like crossing a threshold you'd been standing at for twelve years, finally brave enough to step through.

Inside, the space smelled like woodsmoke and pine. Simple furniture worn smooth by use. Books stacked on every surface—fiction and pack history, field guides and poetry collections. A worn flannel shirt draped over a chair that Ethan remembered from years ago. The kind of comfortable, lived-in space that said someone actually *existed* here, not just passed through maintaining the illusion of control.

Caleb built a fire while Ethan looked around, fingers trailing over book spines, touching the carved wolf figurine on the mantel, reacquainting himself with the tangible evidence of Caleb's life. All the parts of him that existed beyond Alpha. The person who read mystery novels and collected owl feathers and apparently had a weakness for terrible action movies if the DVD collection was any indication.

"It suits you," Ethan said quietly.

"Thanks." Caleb watched the flames catch and grow, orange light dancing across his face. Then he stood and turned, and the vulnerability in his expression made Ethan's chest ache. "I'm nervous."

"About what?"

"This. Us. Not screwing it up again." He crossed his arms, then dropped them, like he couldn't figure out what to do with his hands. "Not losing you a second time."

Ethan crossed the room and cupped Caleb's face in both hands. The stubble rough against his palms. The warmth of skin. The steady, human realness of him. "We're going to screw it up sometimes. That's what people do. We'll say the wrong thing or make assumptions or forget to communicate when we should. But we're also going to try. And talk. And choose each other even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard."

"Promise?"

"I promise." Ethan pressed their foreheads together, breathing him in. Pine and woodsmoke and that indefinable something that was purely Caleb. "I'm not eighteen anymore. I'm not going to run the first time things get difficult."

"What if I'm difficult?"

"Then I'll love you anyway." Ethan smiled against his mouth. "You're worth it. Worth staying for. Worth fighting for."

Caleb made a sound low in his throat—half laugh, half something that might have been a sob. "I don't know what I did to deserve you."

"You stood on a stage in front of the whole town and told them you loved me. Pretty sure that counts for something."

"Public humiliation as courtship ritual?"

"In Maple Hollow? Absolutely."

Caleb kissed him. Slow and deep, tasting like coming home. Ethan made a soft sound against his mouth, arms winding around his neck, body pressing close.

When they finally broke apart, breathless, Caleb said, "Stay tonight."

"I was planning to."

"No, I mean..." He paused, searching for words. "Stay in a way that means something. Stay like you're not planning to leave in the morning."

Ethan's expression went impossibly soft. "Caleb. I'm not leaving in the morning. Or the morning after that. I'm staying in Maple Hollow. I'm staying with you."

"You're sure?"

"I've never been more sure of anything."

The fire crackled. The moonlight spilled through the windows. And Caleb felt the last of his careful control dissolve, replaced by something warmer and truer.

Trust. Hope. Love that didn't need to hide anymore.

They stayed up late, talking and touching and learning each other again. Building the foundation of something that could last. Something honest.

And outside, the moon climbed to its zenith, flooding Maple Hollow with silver-gold light. The festival wound down. The town settled into sleep. The ward ribbons glowed steady and strong.

Magic and truth, woven together under the Harvest Moon.

The way they'd always been meant to be.
