Steam ghosted across the café window, and Ethan's reflection smiled back at him like someone half in love with the morning.

He caught himself mid-smile and tried to dial it back to something more professional, more journalist-doing-fieldwork and less man-waiting-for-a-maybe-date. It didn't work. His reflection kept grinning like an idiot, backlit by the warm glow of Howl & Bean's interior and probably sending signals to every person on Main Street that Ethan Cole was having *feelings*.

Inappropriate feelings. Complicated feelings. Feelings that had no place in what was supposed to be a straightforward interview about pack dynamics and festival logistics.

He pulled his recorder from his messenger bag and set it on the small corner table he'd claimed, adjusting its position three times before admitting he was stalling. Nine o'clock, they'd agreed. It was 8:47. Caleb would be here soon, and Ethan needed to get his head straight before then.

This was work. Professional documentation. He had questions prepared—good questions about pack hierarchy, about the festival's role in maintaining supernatural-human relations, about how the town managed to stay hidden in plain sight when most other supernatural communities either isolated themselves completely or integrated so thoroughly they lost their distinct culture.

Questions that had nothing to do with the way Caleb had looked at him last night in the tavern, standing close enough that Ethan could count his heartbeats. Nothing to do with how their hands had brushed on the door handle, or how that brief contact had felt like permission and promise and possibility all compressed into a single second.

Nothing to do with the fact that Ethan had walked home last night practically floating, then spent two hours lying awake replaying their conversation and wondering what would have happened if those people hadn't passed by on the street. If the moment hadn't broken. If Caleb had closed that last foot of distance instead of letting Ethan leave.

Professional. He was a professional.

The café smelled like heaven—espresso and cinnamon and something baking that involved maple syrup in ways that were probably illegal in states with stricter health codes. Howl & Bean was Ruby's domain, and she'd transformed what had been a generic coffee shop into something distinctly Maple Hollow: exposed brick walls covered in local art, mismatched furniture that somehow worked together, a chalkboard menu that changed daily based on Ruby's mood and whatever ingredients she'd impulse-bought at the farmer's market.

This early on a Tuesday, the place was pleasantly busy without being crowded. A handful of locals occupied other tables—Mrs. Chen from the bookstore working through a crossword puzzle, two teenagers who were definitely cutting class but doing it quietly enough that no one seemed to care, a man Ethan vaguely recognized from somewhere doing something intense with a laptop and multiple highlighters.

The front window was fogged from the temperature differential, inside warm and outside still holding October's chill. Condensation ran down the glass in slow rivulets, distorting the view of Main Street into something impressionistic. Sunlight filtered through, turning the steam from the espresso machine into golden clouds.

Ethan had positioned himself at the corner table specifically because it offered a clear view of the door while also being slightly tucked away from the main flow of foot traffic. Private enough for conversation, public enough that this was clearly A Professional Meeting and not—whatever his racing pulse seemed to think it was.

Ruby appeared from behind the counter, two mugs in hand. She set one in front of Ethan with the particular emphasis of someone making a point.

"Maple cinnamon latte," she announced. "Extra shot because you look like you didn't sleep. And before you ask, yes, I'm judging you for that."

"I slept fine," Ethan lied.

"You have bags under your eyes and you've checked your reflection in the window four times since you sat down." Ruby slid into the chair across from him uninvited, cradling her own mug. "You're nervous."

"I'm not nervous. I'm preparing for an interview."

"Right. An interview. With Caleb. Who you definitely don't have complicated feelings about." Her grin was knowing and deeply annoying. "That's why you've rearranged your recorder three times and keep smoothing your shirt like you're about to meet the president."

Ethan glanced down. His shirt—a dark green henley that he'd definitely not chosen because it was Caleb's favorite color, absolutely not—was perfectly fine. He forced his hands to stay on the table instead of reflexively checking his collar again.

"It's a professional interview," he said firmly. "I have questions about pack dynamics. Festival traditions. How the town maintains its supernatural identity while remaining economically viable in a region dominated by tourism."

"Fascinating." Ruby's tone suggested it was anything but. "And you couldn't have asked those questions at literally any other time? You had to schedule a one-on-one breakfast meeting at the most romantic table in my café?"

"This is the most romantic table?"

"Corner position, best natural light, far enough from the counter that conversations feel intimate." Ruby ticked off points on her fingers. "I literally designed this space with dates in mind. You walked in here, looked around, and beelined straight for the makeout corner."

"It's not—there's no making out happening in this corner."

"Not yet," Ruby said cheerfully. "But the morning is young."

Before Ethan could formulate a response that involved telling his cousin to mind her own business, the café door opened. Cold air rushed in, carrying the scent of autumn and pine.

Caleb stepped inside.

Ethan's breath did something complicated that definitely wasn't compatible with casual professionalism.

Caleb looked—good. Really good. He wore dark jeans and a grey henley that fit him in ways that should probably be regulated, his hair slightly damp like he'd showered recently. He carried himself with that particular Caleb confidence, the kind that came from knowing exactly who he was and being comfortable in that knowledge.

Their eyes met across the café. Caleb's expression shifted—warmed—in a way that made Ethan's pulse spike.

"Oh my god," Ruby muttered under her breath. "You two are ridiculous."

"Ruby—"

But she was already standing, grabbing her mug. "I'll leave you to your very professional interview about pack logistics." She patted Ethan's shoulder as she passed. "Try not to make it too obvious you're flirting. Some of us have reputations to maintain."

She disappeared back behind the counter before Ethan could protest, leaving him alone at the table as Caleb approached.

"Hey," Caleb said, and somehow that single syllable carried warmth and humor and about twelve different subtexts.

"Hey." Ethan gestured to the empty chair Ruby had vacated. "Thanks for meeting me. I know you're probably busy with festival stuff."

"Always busy with festival stuff." Caleb settled into the chair, and suddenly the table felt much smaller. "But I can spare an hour for an interview. Or whatever this is."

The "whatever this is" hung in the air between them, weighted with last night's almost-moment.

"Interview," Ethan said, perhaps too quickly. "Definitely an interview. I have questions." He gestured to his recorder as evidence. "See? Very official."

Caleb's smile was small but genuine. "You asking for quotes or company?"

The question—light, teasing, but underneath it something more serious—made Ethan's carefully prepared professional distance wobble dangerously.

"Company makes better copy," he heard himself say.

"Does it?"

"Absolutely. Sources are more candid when they're comfortable. It's basic journalism."

"Right. Basic journalism." Caleb's eyes held amusement and something warmer. "And you're comfortable?"

Was he? Sitting across from Caleb in morning light, with the smell of coffee and cinnamon and that particular cedar-and-pine scent that was just *Caleb*, was Ethan comfortable?

No. He was the opposite of comfortable. He was acutely aware of every inch of space between them, of how Caleb's hands rested on the table close enough to touch, of the way morning light caught in his eyes and made them look more gold than brown.

But he was also—happy. In a way he hadn't been in a long time. The kind of happy that felt dangerous because it made him want things he'd spent twelve years teaching himself not to want.

"Getting there," he said, which was honest enough.

Ruby appeared again, this time with a mug for Caleb and a plate of pastries. "Maple scones," she announced, setting them down. "Fresh from the oven. On the house, because apparently I'm a romantic sap who enables emotionally complicated reunions."

"Ruby—" Ethan started.

"Also, Mara dropped these off earlier." She produced two small sachets from her apron pocket, setting one by each of their mugs. "She said something about 'clarity and courage' and winked at me in a way that suggested I should absolutely give these to you."

"What's in them?" Caleb asked, examining his sachet with the wary interest of someone who'd known Mara for a long time.

"Lavender, rosemary, and probably good intentions." Ruby grinned. "Or a love spell. With Mara, it's hard to tell. Anyway, enjoy your professional interview about pack dynamics."

She left again, this time with an exaggerated wink that made Ethan want to sink through his chair.

"Sorry about her," Ethan said. "She's—enthusiastic."

"She's Ruby." Caleb picked up his mug, inhaling the steam. "And she's not wrong. This is a good table."

"She told you about the makeout corner thing?"

"Didn't have to. I've been in this café before." Caleb's smile was definitely teasing now. "I know which tables are for business meetings and which ones are for—other purposes."

"And you came anyway."

"I did." Caleb took a sip of his coffee, his gaze steady over the rim. "Should I not have?"

The question was casual on the surface, but underneath it Ethan heard what Caleb was really asking: *Are we doing this? Are we acknowledging what's happening between us, or are we going to keep pretending this is just professional courtesy?*

Ethan reached for his own mug, needing something to do with his hands. The coffee was perfect—sweet and spiced and warm enough to feel grounding. He took a breath, made a decision.

"No," he said. "I'm glad you're here."

Something in Caleb's expression softened. "Good."

They sat there for a moment, drinking coffee and not quite acknowledging that this had already stopped being an interview and started being something else entirely.

"So," Ethan said eventually, reaching for his recorder. "Should we—"

"Actually." Caleb leaned forward slightly. "Can I ask you something first? Off the record?"

Ethan's hand stilled on the recorder. "Okay."

"Why'd you really come back?" Caleb's voice was quiet, serious. "Ruby's podcast is great, but you could have covered the festival remotely. Hell, half the journalists who write about Maple Hollow never actually visit. But you came back. In person. Why?"

The question landed with more weight than its simple construction suggested. Because Caleb wasn't just asking about professional motivation—he was asking about Ethan's intentions. About whether this was temporary convenience or something more deliberate.

Ethan could deflect. Could fall back on the easy answer about research and authentic documentation and needing boots-on-the-ground perspective for the feature piece.

Or he could be honest.

He set down his mug carefully, met Caleb's eyes.

"Because I wanted to see if it still felt like home," he said quietly. "I've spent twelve years building a life in the city, chasing stories, proving I could be more than just the kid from a small town who left because he couldn't handle grief. And I did that. I proved it. But lately—" He paused, searching for words. "Lately I've been wondering if proving you can leave is the same as proving you should stay gone."

Caleb was very still, listening with the full attention that Ethan remembered from years ago. The way Caleb always listened—not just waiting for his turn to talk, but actually *hearing* what was being said.

"And?" Caleb prompted gently.

"And two days back, and I'm remembering why I loved it here. The way everyone knows everyone. The magic that's just part of daily life instead of something to hide. The—" He caught himself before saying *you*. "The connections. The way relationships here are built on years of shared history instead of networking events and LinkedIn profiles."

"You love the city," Caleb observed. "I've read your articles. You write about it like it matters."

"It does matter. But that doesn't mean—" Ethan stopped, frustrated with his own inability to articulate this. "I think maybe I've been treating places like they're mutually exclusive. Like loving one means rejecting the other. But sitting here now, I don't know if that's true. Maybe I can love what I built in the city and still miss what I left here."

The admission hung between them, vulnerable and honest.

Caleb was quiet for a moment, his fingers tracing the rim of his mug in slow, thoughtful circles. "For what it's worth," he said finally, "I don't think you have to choose. The city will still be there when the festival's over. And if you wanted to—if coming back here occasionally was something you were interested in—" He paused, then met Ethan's eyes with something that looked like hope. "The town would be glad to have you. I would be glad to have you."

Ethan's heart did something acrobatic in his chest. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

The word was simple, direct, everything that Caleb was. No games, no deflection. Just honest want offered without apology.

They sat there looking at each other over coffee and Mara's potentially magical sachets, and Ethan felt something shift in his chest. Some weight he'd been carrying for twelve years—the weight of choosing wrong, of running away, of burning bridges he'd thought could never be rebuilt—lightened just slightly.

"Okay," he said. "That's—okay. Good to know."

Caleb's smile was warm, genuine. "Now do you want to ask me about pack dynamics, or should we keep having important conversations disguised as casual coffee?"

"Can we do both?"

"We can definitely do both."

Ethan reached for his recorder, turning it on. The small red light blinked to life, steady and present. "Alright, Alpha Hawthorne. Let's start with an easy one. How long have you been leading the pack?"

"Eight years officially. Though I was doing most of the Alpha work for two years before that, after my dad died."

Ethan already knew this, but it was good opening material. "That's young for an Alpha. How'd the pack respond?"

"Cautiously at first." Caleb broke off a piece of scone, considering his words. "I was twenty-two and convinced I knew everything. They were patient with me while I learned that leadership isn't about dominance—it's about trust. About showing up consistently and making the pack feel safe enough to be themselves."

"And now?"

"Now we're steady." Caleb's expression was thoughtful. "Not perfect, but solid. They know I'll prioritize their welfare. I know they'll trust me even when decisions are hard. It's—" He paused, searching for words. "It's family, in the way family should work. Chosen, intentional, built on mutual respect instead of obligation."

Ethan made notes, though his recorder was catching everything. Something about writing helped him process, helped him notice the nuances in what was being said.

"The festival is a pack tradition," Ethan said. "But it's also clearly something the whole town participates in. How do you balance the supernatural elements with making it accessible to human residents?"

"It's not about balance—it's about integration." Caleb leaned forward slightly, warming to the topic. "The magic isn't separate from daily life here. It's woven into everything. The humans who choose to live in Maple Hollow do it because they want to be part of a community where the supernatural is celebrated, not hidden. So the festival isn't about 'letting humans participate'—it's about the whole town choosing to honor the things that make us unique."

"Even when that means tourists come looking for an authentic magical experience and end up treating the town like a theme park?"

Caleb grimaced slightly. "That's the tension, yeah. We want to share our culture, but we also want to protect it from becoming performance. That's why the really significant moments—the pack run, the midnight ceremony, certain rituals—those remain closed to outsiders. You have to be trusted before you're invited."

Ethan glanced at his notes. "And who decides who gets trusted?"

"The town does. Collectively." Caleb took another sip of coffee. "It's not a formal process. But if you show up with genuine respect, if you listen more than you document, if you treat people's magic as sacred instead of content—people notice. And eventually, if you stick around long enough, you stop being an outsider."

The words felt weighted with more than just general observation. Ethan heard the implicit message: *You could stop being an outsider again. If you wanted to.*

"What about people who left and came back?" Ethan asked, keeping his voice light even though the question felt anything but. "How does the town handle that?"

Caleb's expression shifted—something softer, more personal entering his features. "Depends on why they left and how they come back. If someone left because they needed to grow, because they needed space to figure out who they were—the town understands that. Leaving isn't betrayal. It's just part of some people's journey."

"And coming back?"

"Coming back is always allowed." Caleb's gaze held Ethan's. "Especially if you come back honest. If you don't pretend you weren't gone, don't pretend it didn't hurt. The town values truth over consistency. You can leave and come back and leave again, as long as you're honest about what you're doing."

Ethan's throat felt tight. "That's generous."

"It's practical." But Caleb's voice was gentle. "Community doesn't mean trapping people. It means creating a place worth returning to."

They sat in that for a moment. The café continued around them—Ruby calling out orders, the espresso machine hissing, the low murmur of other conversations. But at their corner table, everything felt suspended. Intimate.

Ethan reached for a scone, needing to do something with his hands. The pastry was still warm, flaky and sweet with maple glaze. He took a bite and nearly groaned.

"Ruby's gotten really good at this," he said.

"She's been practicing." Caleb watched him with amusement. "You have a crumb—"

He reached across the table, his hand moving to Ethan's face. His thumb brushed along Ethan's cheekbone, gentle and brief, catching the stray bit of scone. The touch lasted maybe two seconds. Less than two seconds.

It felt like permission and promise and a dozen other things Ethan didn't have words for.

Caleb pulled his hand back, examining the crumb on his thumb with mock seriousness. "Crisis averted."

Ethan couldn't breathe properly. His cheek still felt warm where Caleb had touched it—phantom sensation that had no business lasting this long.

"Thanks," he managed.

"Anytime."

The way Caleb said it—light but sincere, casual but weighted—made it clear he wasn't just talking about scone crumbs.

Ethan grabbed his coffee, took a drink that was probably too large, tried to remember how professional journalism worked. "So—um. Pack dynamics. You mentioned trust being central. How does that play out in practice?"

If Caleb noticed Ethan's complete lack of composure, he was kind enough not to mention it. "Communication, mostly. Weekly check-ins, open door policy, making sure everyone knows they can come to me with problems before those problems become crises."

"What kind of problems come up?"

"The usual." Caleb settled back in his chair, and Ethan mourned the loss of their proximity. "Shift control issues, especially for new wolves. Interpersonal conflicts that need mediation. Balancing pack needs with personal lives. Helping people navigate the complications that come with being supernatural in a world that mostly thinks we're folklore."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It's exhausting," Caleb agreed. "But it's also—important. These are my people. Making sure they're okay, making sure they feel safe enough to be fully themselves—that matters more than my convenience."

It was such a Caleb answer. Self-sacrificing and sincere, rooted in genuine care but edged with the kind of self-neglect that had probably been building for eight years.

"What about making sure you're okay?" Ethan asked quietly. "Who takes care of the Alpha?"

Caleb's expression flickered—surprise, then something more guarded. "I have people. Nico's good about checking in. Jasper won't let me skip meals or work myself into burnout. Mara—" He smiled slightly. "Mara just knows, somehow, when I'm struggling. Shows up with tea and extremely unsolicited advice."

"But it's not the same as having someone whose job isn't to support the Alpha, but just to be there for Caleb." Ethan wasn't sure where the boldness was coming from. "Someone you don't have to be strong for."

The silence that followed was weighted, significant. Caleb's eyes held his with an intensity that made Ethan acutely aware of every inch of space between them.

"No," Caleb said finally. "It's not the same."

The admission sat between them like a gift, fragile and precious.

"For the record," Ethan said, his voice barely above a murmur, "I think you're allowed to want that. To want someone who sees you as more than your role."

"Yeah?" Caleb's voice matched his in quietness. "You offering to be that person?"

The question should have been too much, too fast. Should have sent Ethan scrambling for professional distance and appropriate boundaries.

Instead, he found himself saying: "Maybe. If you wanted me to be."

"I want you to be."

The words were simple, direct, devastating in their honesty. No deflection, no careful Alpha diplomacy. Just Caleb, offering truth like it was easy, like vulnerability didn't cost him anything.

Except Ethan knew it did cost. Knew that Caleb had spent eight years building walls between duty and desire, between what the pack needed and what he wanted for himself. And here he was, in a coffee shop corner that Ruby had designed specifically for moments like this, breaking those walls down brick by brick.

"Okay," Ethan said, his heart hammering. "Then I am. Being that person. If you want."

"I want." Caleb's smile was small but genuine. "Though we should probably figure out what that means before the whole town starts planning our wedding."

"Too late for that. I'm pretty sure Mrs. Chen has already picked out china patterns."

"She absolutely has." Caleb laughed, and the sound was warm enough that several other café patrons glanced over. "I give it three days before Mayor Vance suggests we co-chair the winter festival planning committee."

"Is that her subtle way of matchmaking?"

"There's nothing subtle about Vance's matchmaking. She once assigned two people to reorganize the town archives specifically because she thought they'd be cute together."

"Did it work?"

"They're married now with two kids and a very organized filing system."

Ethan laughed despite himself, the tension of the last few minutes easing into something warmer, more comfortable. "So what you're saying is we're doomed."

"Doomed to be extremely well-organized and possibly happy." Caleb's expression was light, playful. "Could be worse."

"Could be better."

"How so?"

Ethan gestured to his recorder. "Well, for starters, I could actually be doing my job instead of flirting with my primary source."

"You can't do both?"

"Professionally speaking? No. Ethically, I should maintain appropriate distance."

"And practically speaking?"

"Practically speaking, I stopped maintaining appropriate distance about five minutes into this conversation."

Caleb's smile was knowing. "Pretty sure it was before that. You were nervous when I walked in."

"I was not nervous—"

"You smoothed your shirt twice and repositioned your recorder three times."

Ethan stared at him. "How did you notice that?"

"I notice everything about you." Caleb said it simply, like it wasn't a devastating admission. "Always have."

The weight of that—of being *seen*, of having been seen all along—settled in Ethan's chest like warmth, like coming home to a fire already burning.

"That's—" Ethan started, then stopped because he didn't have words. "That's a lot."

"Too much?"

"No." Ethan met his eyes. "Not too much. Just—unexpected. Good, but unexpected."

They sat there in the morning light, coffee cooling between them, the cafe humming with life around them. Through the fogged window, Ethan could see Main Street waking fully—shop owners opening their doors, tourists beginning their explorations, the town settling into its festival rhythm.

But inside their corner, everything felt suspended. Intimate and charged and full of possibility.

Ruby appeared again, this time with a knowing look that suggested she'd been watching from the counter. "Just so you both know," she said, refilling their mugs without asking, "someone is going to take a picture of you two looking at each other like that, and it's going to end up on the town's social media within an hour."

"Ruby—" Ethan started.

"I'm just saying. Manage expectations." She grinned. "Also, Mara just texted asking if the sachets worked. I told her I'd get back to her, but based on the extremely obvious romantic tension at this table, I'm guessing the answer is yes."

"The sachets are just herbs," Caleb said.

"Right. Herbs. That just happen to encourage emotional honesty and courage." Ruby winked. "Anyway, carry on with your very professional interview. Try to keep the heart-eyes to a minimum. Some of us are trying to run a business here."

She left again, and Ethan dropped his face into his hands. "I'm going to kill her."

"She means well."

"She means chaos."

"That too." Caleb was definitely laughing at him. "But she's not wrong about the picture thing. Mrs. Chen has her phone out."

Ethan looked up sharply. Sure enough, Mrs. Chen at the next table over was holding her phone at an angle that was absolutely not subtle.

"This town," Ethan muttered.

"Is invested in your happiness," Caleb finished. "Get used to it. They've been waiting twelve years for this."

"For what? Us having coffee?"

"For you to come home and remember why you belonged here in the first place." Caleb's voice was gentle, serious under the humor. "The town loves you, Ethan. Always has. They're just excited you're letting yourself love it back."

The words landed with unexpected weight. Because Caleb was right—the town did love him. Had never stopped loving him, even when he'd left. Had held space for his absence and welcomed him back without condition.

And maybe—maybe that was enough. Maybe he didn't have to have everything figured out right now. Didn't have to choose between city and town, between career and roots, between the life he'd built and the one he'd left behind.

Maybe he could just be here, now, in this moment. Drinking good coffee and eating better scones and sitting across from someone who saw him—really saw him—and chose to be there anyway.

"Okay," Ethan said finally. "New plan. We finish this interview like professionals. I ask you thoughtful questions about pack dynamics and festival traditions. You give me quotable answers that will make excellent copy."

"And then?"

"And then—" Ethan paused, made himself brave. "And then maybe we do this again tomorrow. Not as an interview. Just—coffee. Or breakfast. Or whatever you want to call two people spending time together because they enjoy each other's company."

Caleb's smile was warm, genuine, everything Ethan remembered and nothing like the careful Alpha composure he usually maintained. "I'd like that."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

They spent the next forty-five minutes actually doing the interview—Ethan asking questions about pack structure and supernatural integration, Caleb providing thoughtful answers that would make excellent material for the feature piece. But underneath the professional exchange, something else hummed. An awareness, a warmth, a growing certainty that this was just the beginning of something neither of them had quite put words to yet.

When they finally stood to leave, nearly two hours after Caleb had first walked in, Ethan reached to turn off his recorder and found Caleb's hand already there. Their fingers brushed—brief, intentional, warm.

"Tomorrow?" Caleb asked.

"Tomorrow," Ethan confirmed.

They walked out together into October sunshine that felt warmer than it should, given the temperature. Behind them, Ruby called out something that was probably teasing but definitely affectionate. Mrs. Chen waved at them with undisguised approval.

Outside, Caleb paused on the sidewalk, turning to face Ethan. "Thanks for breakfast."

"Thanks for the interview." Ethan smiled. "Even though we both know that's not what this was."

"No," Caleb agreed. "But I think we got some good material anyway."

They stood there for another beat, neither quite ready to separate. Main Street moved around them—festival preparations continuing, tourists exploring, the town humming with life.

"I should—" Caleb gestured vaguely toward the square. "Pack things. Festival logistics."

"Right. And I have notes to transcribe, an article to outline."

"Tomorrow though."

"Tomorrow."

Caleb reached out, his hand finding Ethan's wrist. The touch was brief, gentle, deliberate. "I'm glad you came back."

"Me too," Ethan said, and meant it completely.

They separated then, walking in opposite directions down Main Street. But when Ethan glanced back after half a block, he found Caleb looking back at the same moment. Their eyes met. They both smiled.

Ethan continued walking, his hand unconsciously moving to his wrist where Caleb had touched him. The skin there felt warm, sensitized, like it was remembering contact.

His cheek too—where Caleb had brushed away the crumb—still felt warm hours later as Ethan sat in Aunt Sophie's house transcribing his interview notes.

He kept replaying the morning. The way Caleb had looked at him over coffee. The honesty in his voice when he'd said *I want you to be that person*. The careful restraint that had somehow made every small touch feel monumental.

Ruby texted him around three: *You're trending on the Maple Hollow community board. #coffeeshopcourtship #hesgonnastayisn'the*

Ethan should probably be concerned about that. Should maybe worry about boundaries or professional ethics or the complications of small-town visibility.

Instead, he found himself smiling at his phone, his cheek still warm with phantom touch, his heart full of something that felt remarkably like coming home.

Tomorrow, he thought. They'd see each other tomorrow.

And somehow, that felt like enough. Like possibility. Like the beginning of something he'd stopped letting himself imagine twelve years ago but was finally—finally—brave enough to want again.
