# Chapter 9 – Shelter and Sparks

The storm hadn't followed them inside, but it left the air aching for thunder.

Ethan stood dripping in Caleb's cabin, rain pooling on worn floorboards, and tried to remember how breathing worked. His jacket clung cold to his shoulders. His jeans stuck to his legs. Water ran from his hair down the back of his neck. None of it mattered because Caleb was watching him with an expression Ethan couldn't quite name—something between concern and hunger, restraint and need.

"You're soaked," Caleb said.

"So are you." Ethan's voice came out steadier than he felt. The flannel Caleb had given him on the trail was still draped over his shoulders, but it was damp now too, carrying Caleb's scent mixed with rain and pine resin.

Caleb's mouth quirked. "I run warmer."

"Shifter perks." Ethan tried for humor, but his teeth were starting to chatter. Not from cold exactly—though the air *was* cool now that adrenaline was fading—but from something else. The way Caleb was looking at him. The way the cabin felt too small and too large at once, intimate and exposed.

"Let me get the fire going." Caleb moved past him, close enough that Ethan caught his scent—smoke and cedar and something earthy that Ethan had never been able to name but had missed more than he'd admitted. "And find you something dry to wear."

"I'm fine."

"You're shivering."

"I'm—" Ethan stopped. Nodded. "Okay. Yeah. That would be good."

The cabin was small, open-plan, with a stone fireplace dominating one wall and large windows looking out toward the forest. There was a kitchen area tucked into one corner, a worn leather couch facing the hearth, a table by the window. A ladder led to a loft bedroom. Everything was wood and warmth, simple and lived-in. It smelled like Caleb, which shouldn't have been comforting but was.

Ethan watched Caleb crouch by the fireplace, stacking kindling with practiced efficiency. His wet shirt clung to his shoulders, outlining muscle. His hair was dark with rain, curling slightly at the nape. He moved with the same steady grace he always had—certain, unhurried, like he had all the time in the world.

Ethan's chest ached.

Caleb glanced back. "You okay?"

"Yeah." Ethan's voice caught. "Just... taking it in."

"The cabin?"

"You. Here. This." He gestured vaguely. "It's very you."

"That good or bad?"

"Good. Definitely good."

Something warm flickered in Caleb's expression before he turned back to the fire. A moment later flames caught, crackling bright and hungry. Golden light spilled across the floor, chasing shadows into corners.

Caleb stood, brushed off his hands. "Stay here. I'll grab you something to change into."

He disappeared up the ladder before Ethan could protest. Left alone, Ethan peeled off Caleb's damp flannel and his own soaked jacket, laying them over a chair near the fire. His shirt underneath was wet but not drenched. He could probably leave it on. Should probably leave it on. This was already intimate enough—standing in Caleb's home, firelight warming his skin, the scent of smoke and cedar wrapping around him like an invitation.

"Here." Caleb's voice came from behind him.

Ethan turned. Caleb had changed into dry jeans and a thermal henley that clung to his frame in ways that made Ethan's mouth go dry. He was holding out a soft gray t-shirt and flannel sleep pants.

"They'll be big on you," Caleb said. "But they're warm."

"Thanks." Ethan took them, fingers brushing Caleb's. The touch was brief but electric, sending heat up his arm that had nothing to do with the fire.

"You can change in the bathroom if you want. Or—" Caleb gestured vaguely toward the loft.

"Here's fine." Ethan said it before his brain caught up with his mouth. "If that's okay."

Caleb's gaze held his for a long moment. "Yeah. It's okay."

He didn't turn away. Didn't give Ethan privacy. Just stood there, watching, as Ethan pulled his wet shirt over his head and let it drop to the floor. The air felt cool against his skin. Goosebumps rose on his arms, his chest. He could feel Caleb's gaze like a physical touch, tracking the movement of his hands, the rise and fall of his breathing.

"You have a new scar," Caleb said quietly. "On your ribs."

Ethan glanced down at the thin white line just below his right side. "Bike accident. Chicago. Couple years ago."

"You okay?"

"Yeah. Just stupid. I wasn't paying attention."

"You never did watch where you were going." There was no judgment in Caleb's voice, only fondness. "Always too busy looking at everything else."

Ethan pulled on the t-shirt. It smelled like laundry detergent and Caleb, and it was big enough that it hung loose on his frame. "Is that a complaint?"

"An observation."

"You always were observant." Ethan tugged off his wet jeans, acutely aware of Caleb's presence, and stepped into the sleep pants. They were too long, pooling around his ankles, and the waistband sat low on his hips. "Better?"

"Warmer, anyway." Caleb's voice was rougher now, lower. His gaze hadn't left Ethan's face. "Come sit by the fire. I'll make us something hot to drink."

"I can help—"

"Sit." It wasn't quite an order, but there was enough alpha authority in it that Ethan's body responded before his brain could argue. He moved to the couch, sank into worn leather that was surprisingly comfortable, and watched Caleb move around the small kitchen.

The fire crackled beside him. Rain drummed steadily on the roof, a white noise that made the cabin feel even more like a refuge carved out of the storm. Through the window he could see the forest, dark and dripping, trees bending in wind. But inside everything was warm and still and safe.

Caleb returned with two mugs, handed one to Ethan before settling on the opposite end of the couch. Not touching, but close enough that Ethan could feel his warmth.

"What is this?" Ethan inhaled steam—cinnamon, honey, something herbal.

"Apple cider with a shot of whiskey. Ruby makes the cider. The whiskey's mine."

"Ruby makes everything in this town, doesn't she?"

"Pretty much." Caleb smiled over his mug. "She'd run the world if we let her."

Ethan took a sip. The cider was sweet and tart, the whiskey a pleasant burn. It warmed him from the inside out, spreading heat through his chest. "This is good."

"She'd be insufferable if she heard you say that."

"Then we won't tell her."

They drank in comfortable silence for a moment. The fire popped, sending sparks up the chimney. Outside, thunder rumbled distantly—the storm moving away but not quite gone.

"So," Ethan said eventually. "This is your place."

"Has been for about eight years. Built it myself, mostly. Pack helped with the heavy lifting."

"It's nice." Ethan looked around, taking in details he'd missed before. Books stacked on shelves, a guitar leaning against the wall, photographs tucked into the window frame—pack gatherings, harvest festivals, the forest in different seasons. No photos of Ethan, but that made sense. "Suits you."

"You sound surprised."

"I guess I am, a little. When we were younger, you always talked about traveling. Seeing other packs, other territories."

"I did that." Caleb's voice was thoughtful. "For a few years after you left, I traveled. Visited packs up and down the coast. Learned from other alphas. But I kept coming back here."

"Why?"

"Because this is home." Caleb met his eyes. "Not just the place. The people. The pack. They needed me, and I—" He paused. "I needed them too. Being alpha isn't just about strength or authority. It's about connection. Knowing your people, being known by them."

Ethan's chest tightened. "You're good at that. The knowing part."

"Not always." Caleb's smile was rueful. "I wasn't good at knowing you. What you needed, what you wanted."

"I wasn't exactly forthcoming."

"No. But I should've asked more. Listened better." Caleb turned his mug in his hands, watching firelight play across the ceramic. "I keep thinking about the night you left. What I should've said differently."

"Caleb—"

"I know. We've been over this. But sitting here now, with you in my home, wearing my clothes—" His voice roughed. "I need you to know I would've chosen you. If I'd understood you were asking me to choose."

Ethan's breath caught. "I wasn't asking. That's the problem. I just expected you to know."

"And I expected you to stay." Caleb looked at him then, fully, and Ethan saw twelve years of longing in his expression. "We were both idiots."

"Yeah." Ethan's laugh was shaky. "We really were."

"Are we still?"

"I don't know." Ethan set his mug on the floor, leaned back against the couch. "I feel pretty stupid right now. Sitting here, half-drunk on your cider, wearing your clothes, wanting—" He stopped himself.

"Wanting what?"

"You." The word came out quieter than intended. "Still. Again. More than I should."

Caleb went very still. "Why shouldn't you?"

"Because I don't know if I'm staying. Because I still don't know if I can be part of this world without losing myself. Because—" Ethan's voice cracked. "Because last time I wanted you this much, it destroyed me when I had to leave."

"And if you don't have to leave?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Ethan closed his eyes. "I keep asking myself what I'm doing here. What I want. And all I know is that when I'm with you, I feel like I can breathe again. Like I've been holding my breath for twelve years and finally found air."

The couch shifted. Ethan opened his eyes to find Caleb closer now, the space between them narrowed to inches. Close enough to touch. Close enough to kiss.

"Ethan." Caleb's voice was low, careful. "If this is too much—if you need me to slow down—"

"No." Ethan reached out, fingers finding Caleb's jaw, the scratch of stubble against his palm. "I don't want slow. I want—" He leaned in. "I want this."

"You sure?"

"Terrified," Ethan admitted. "But sure."

Caleb's hand came up to cover Ethan's, holding it against his face. "Me too."

The kiss was inevitable, had been since the observatory, maybe since Ethan first walked back into Maple Hollow. But this time there was no storm, no adrenaline, no excuse beyond want and choice and the simple truth that they'd been dancing around each other for days and Ethan was tired of pretending he didn't want this.

Caleb kissed like he did everything else—steady and thorough and patient. He tasted like cider and whiskey and promise. His hand came up to cup Ethan's face, thumb stroking his cheekbone, and Ethan made a sound he'd later refuse to acknowledge as a whimper.

"Okay?" Caleb murmured against his mouth.

"More than okay." Ethan's hands found Caleb's shirt, fisting in the fabric. "Don't stop."

"Wasn't planning on it."

They kissed deeper, slower, learning each other again. Ethan had forgotten how good this felt—how right. The way Caleb's lips moved against his, patient and purposeful. The way his hands were careful but certain, holding Ethan like he was precious. The way his scent wrapped around Ethan like safety, like home.

When they finally pulled apart, both breathing hard, Caleb pressed his forehead to Ethan's. "I've wanted to do that since the moment you walked into the Tavern."

"Just that?"

"No." Caleb's laugh was rough. "Not just that."

"Tell me."

"I wanted to pull you into the back room and kiss you until you remembered why you came back. Wanted to wrap you in my jacket and keep you warm. Wanted—" He paused. "Wanted to ask if you'd thought about me even half as much as I've thought about you."

"More," Ethan said. "I've thought about you more."

"Impossible."

"Try me." Ethan's hands slid up Caleb's chest, feeling the solid warmth of him. "Do you know how many times I almost came back? How many times I picked up the phone and stared at your number?"

"Why didn't you?"

"Pride. Fear. The same reason I left in the first place—I thought if I came back, I'd lose myself again. That I'd become who you needed me to be instead of who I was."

"And now?"

"Now I think maybe I lost myself by leaving." Ethan's voice was quiet. "And maybe coming back is how I find myself again."

Caleb pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. "I don't want you to be anyone but yourself, Ethan. I never did."

"I know that now. But when we were younger—when I was younger—I didn't know how to be myself *and* be with you. Didn't know it was possible."

"And now?"

"Now I want to try." Ethan kissed him again, quick and sure. "If you'll let me."

"Let you?" Caleb's smile was crooked. "Ethan, I've been yours since we were seventeen. That hasn't changed."

Something in Ethan's chest cracked open—not breaking, but blooming. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"Then take me to bed."

Caleb went still. "You sure?"

"I've never been more sure of anything." Ethan stood, held out his hand. "Unless you'd rather talk more about our feelings."

"I'd rather show you mine." Caleb took his hand, rose, and led him toward the ladder.

The loft was small and warm, the bed taking up most of the space. Skylights in the roof showed rain-streaked glass and dark clouds. A single lamp on the bedside table cast golden light across rumpled sheets. It smelled like Caleb—cedar and smoke and something wild that made Ethan's pulse quicken.

Caleb turned to face him. "Last chance to change your mind."

"Not a chance." Ethan reached for him, pulled him close. "I want this. Want you."

"Then you have me."

They fell onto the bed together, a tangle of limbs and laughter that quickly turned heated. Caleb's hands found the hem of Ethan's borrowed shirt, pushed it up and off. His palms were warm against Ethan's skin, mapping his ribs, his chest, the line of his throat.

"You're so beautiful," Caleb murmured. "I forgot—no, that's a lie. I never forgot. Just tried not to think about it."

"How'd that work out?"

"Terribly." Caleb kissed his collarbone, his shoulder, the hollow of his throat. "You've been in my head for twelve years, Ethan. Every interview, every photo I saw of you, every fucking full moon when I'd go running and remember what it felt like when you'd watch me shift—"

Ethan silenced him with a kiss. "I'm here now."

"You are." Caleb's hands found the waistband of the sleep pants, paused. "Tell me what you want."

"Everything." Ethan's breath hitched. "I want everything."

"Then that's what you'll get."

What followed was heat and hands and the slow, thorough way Caleb took him apart. Every touch was purposeful, every kiss deliberate. Caleb's mouth traced down his throat, found the hollow at the base, and Ethan felt his breath hitch, his hands finding purchase in Caleb's hair.

"You taste the same," Caleb murmured against his skin. "Like rain and something sweet I can't name."

"That's—" Ethan's words dissolved into a gasp as Caleb's teeth found his collarbone, not hard enough to hurt but enough to make every nerve ending light up. "That's ridiculous."

"Is it?" Caleb kissed lower, across his chest, tongue tracing patterns that made Ethan's hips lift involuntarily. "You used to taste like coffee and sugar. Now you taste like whiskey and want."

"Caleb—"

"Tell me what you need." Caleb's hands mapped his ribs, his stomach, the jut of his hip bones. "I want to hear you say it."

"I need—" Ethan swallowed hard. "I need you. Everywhere. I need—" His voice caught as Caleb's mouth found his hip, kissed the sharp edge of bone. "That. More of that."

"This?" Caleb's teeth scraped gently, and Ethan's spine arched off the bed.

"Yes. God, yes."

Caleb took his time, learning Ethan's body with the same focused intensity he brought to everything else. He catalogued every response—the way Ethan's breathing stuttered when he kissed behind his knee, the small sounds he made when Caleb's hands gripped his thighs, the way his fingers twisted in the sheets when pleasure built too fast, too bright.

"You're so responsive," Caleb said, voice rough with wonder and want. "I forgot—no. I never forgot. Just tried not to remember."

"Caleb." Ethan's hands found his face, pulled him up for a kiss that was more desperation than finesse. "I need you. Now. Please."

"Not yet." Caleb kissed him deeply, thoroughly. "I've waited twelve years for this. I'm not rushing."

"You're killing me."

"No." Another kiss, this one soft. "I'm worshipping you. There's a difference."

And he did. Caleb touched him like he was precious, like he was worth the patience, like every inch of skin deserved attention. His hands were calloused from work but gentle with intent. His mouth was hot and sure, pressing kisses to places Ethan had forgotten were sensitive—the inside of his wrist, the curve where shoulder met neck, the soft skin behind his ear.

"Please," Ethan heard himself say, though he wasn't sure what he was asking for. More? Less? Everything?

"I've got you." Caleb's hands slid lower, wrapped around him, and Ethan's whole body went taut with sensation. "I've got you."

"I want—" Ethan's voice broke. "I want all of you. Not just this. I want—"

"Me too." Caleb kissed him again, slow and deep. "You sure?"

"Yes." Ethan pulled him closer. "I'm sure. Are you?"

"I've been sure since the observatory." Caleb reached for the bedside table, found what he needed. "Since before that, probably. Since you walked back into my life and I realized I'd never really let you go."

"Then don't." Ethan kissed his jaw, his throat. "Don't let go."

What came next was heat and hunger and the slow, perfect slide of connection. Caleb was careful, patient, reading every response in Ethan's body. When Ethan tensed, he paused. When Ethan urged him on, he moved deeper, slower, until they were locked together in a rhythm that felt inevitable.

Rain drummed on the skylights above them. The lamp cast their shadows on the sloped ceiling, bodies moving together in a dance that felt both new and familiar. Ethan's hands found Caleb's back, his shoulders, his hair. He pulled him closer, deeper, needing more contact, more connection, more *everything*.

"You feel—" Caleb's voice was wrecked. "God, Ethan. You feel perfect."

"Yeah." Ethan wrapped his legs around Caleb's hips, changing the angle, and they both groaned at the sensation. "Like that. Just like that."

Caleb buried his face in Ethan's neck, breathing hard, his hips moving in steady rhythm. "Twelve years. Twelve fucking years I've wanted this."

"Worth the wait?"

"So worth it." Caleb kissed him, swallowed Ethan's gasp as his hand found him again, stroked in time with his thrusts. "Let me hear you. I want to hear you come apart."

Ethan did. His voice broke on Caleb's name, pleasure building bright and urgent at the base of his spine. Caleb's rhythm stuttered, became more urgent, and Ethan knew he was close too. Could feel it in the tension of his muscles, the way his breathing went ragged, the grip of his fingers on Ethan's hip.

"Caleb—"

"I know. I've got you." Caleb kissed him, swallowed whatever Ethan was going to say. "Let go. I've got you."

And Ethan did. Let himself fall, let himself feel, let himself trust that Caleb would catch him. Release hit him like lightning—bright and total and overwhelming. He felt Caleb follow moments later, felt him shake apart in his arms, heard his name spoken like a prayer against his throat.

Above them, rain streaked the skylight. The lamp flickered. The bed creaked with their movement. And Ethan felt himself come undone in the best possible way—not breaking, but opening. Surrendering to sensation, to connection, to the simple truth that this was exactly where he wanted to be.

When they finally collapsed together, breathing hard and tangled in sheets, Caleb pulled him close. Ethan's head found his chest, his heartbeat steady beneath Ethan's ear. For a long moment neither of them spoke. There was just breath and warmth and the rain slowly easing outside.

Ethan felt wrung out in the best way—limbs heavy, mind quiet, body humming with satisfied exhaustion. Caleb's hand moved through his hair, gentle and absent, like he couldn't stop touching now that he was allowed.

"You okay?" Caleb's voice rumbled against Ethan's cheek.

"Yeah." Ethan smiled against his skin. "Better than okay."

"Good." Caleb's hand moved slowly up and down his spine, soothing. "That was—"

"Intense?"

"I was going to say perfect, but intense works too."

Ethan lifted his head, met Caleb's eyes. Found them soft and warm, lit with something that looked remarkably like awe. "It was perfect."

"Yeah?" Caleb's thumb traced his lower lip. "No regrets?"

"Not even one." Ethan kissed his thumb. "You?"

"Are you kidding? I just got to have you in my bed after twelve years of wanting. I have zero regrets." Caleb paused. "Except maybe that we waited so long."

"We weren't ready then."

"No. But we're ready now."

"Are we?" Ethan's voice was soft. "Because this feels really good, Caleb. And that scares me a little. What if I mess it up again?"

"Then we fix it." Caleb pulled him impossibly closer. "Together. That's the difference this time—we're not kids anymore. We know how to communicate. How to ask for what we need."

"You make it sound easy."

"It won't be easy. But it'll be worth it." Caleb kissed his forehead. "You're worth it, Ethan. This is worth it."

Ethan's throat tightened. He buried his face in Caleb's chest, breathed him in—the scent of sex and sweat and something fundamentally *Caleb* that he'd never been able to name. "I don't know how you do that."

"Do what?"

"Make me believe things are possible when I've spent twelve years thinking they weren't."

"Because they are possible." Caleb's arms tightened around him. "We're possible. We're proof."

They lay like that while rain gentled to whispers, while Ethan's breathing evened out, while the world outside faded to insignificance. Caleb's fingers traced idle patterns on his back—circles and lines and shapes that might've been words if Ethan concentrated hard enough. But he didn't want to concentrate. He just wanted to feel.

"What are you drawing?" Ethan asked eventually.

"Nothing specific. Just... touching you. Making sure you're real."

"I'm real."

"Good." Caleb's voice was rough. "Because if this is a dream, I never want to wake up."

"It's not a dream." Ethan kissed his chest, right over his heart. "We're here. This happened. And I'm not going anywhere."

"Not tonight, anyway."

"Not tonight," Ethan agreed. Then, quieter: "Maybe not tomorrow either."

Caleb went very still. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." Ethan lifted his head. "I mean, I still don't have all the answers. But lying here with you, I'm starting to think maybe I don't need them all right now. Maybe it's okay to just... see where this goes."

"That sounds suspiciously like hope."

"Don't get used to it. I'm still a pessimist at heart."

"Noted." Caleb kissed him—slow and sweet and thorough. "Want water? Food? Another blanket? I'm supposed to take care of you after that."

"After what?"

"After I very thoroughly ravished you."

Ethan laughed, the sound bright and surprised. "Ravished? Who says ravished?"

"I do. I'm bringing it back." Caleb's smile was crooked. "Also, you're deflecting. Do you need anything?"

"Just this." Ethan pressed closer. "Just you."

"You have me." Caleb's voice was quiet, serious. "For as long as you want me, you have me."

"That might be a while."

"Good. I'm patient."

They dozed fitfully after that, waking to shift positions or pull blankets higher or kiss lazily in the darkness. At some point Caleb got up to check the fire downstairs, returning with water and a warm washcloth that he used to clean them both with gentle efficiency that made Ethan's chest ache.

"You don't have to—" Ethan started.

"I want to." Caleb's touch was careful, tender. "Let me take care of you."

So Ethan did. Let himself be cared for, let Caleb's hands soothe away any lingering tension, let himself feel cherished in ways he'd forgotten were possible. When Caleb settled back into bed, Ethan curled into him like he belonged there—which, maybe, he did.

"What are you thinking?" Caleb asked eventually.

"That I'm an idiot for waiting twelve years to do this again."

"We both are."

"Yeah." Ethan tilted his head up, found Caleb watching him with an expression that made his breath catch. "But we're here now."

"We are."

"So what happens next?"

"Next," Caleb said slowly, "we sleep. And in the morning we figure out breakfast. And then we take it one day at a time until we figure out the rest."

"That's very zen of you."

"I'm an evolved alpha."

"Is that what they're calling it these days?"

Caleb laughed, the sound warm and genuine. "What do you want to call it?"

"Lucky." Ethan kissed his chest. "I'd call myself lucky."

"Yeah." Caleb's arms tightened around him. "Me too."

They dozed fitfully, waking to shift positions or pull blankets higher or kiss lazily in the darkness. At some point Caleb got up to check the fire downstairs, returning with water and a smile that made Ethan's heart do complicated things. They talked quietly about nothing important—favorite books, worst assignments, the time Ethan tried to cook Thanksgiving dinner and nearly burned down his apartment.

"How are you a functioning adult?" Caleb asked, laughing.

"I eat a lot of takeout."

"I can cook."

"I remember." Ethan's smile was soft. "You made me breakfast once. Scrambled eggs and toast. It was terrible."

"Hey—"

"Lovingly terrible. I ate every bite."

"Because you were a sap."

"Still am, apparently." Ethan kissed his shoulder. "When it comes to you, anyway."

Caleb went quiet. When Ethan looked up, he found Caleb watching him with an intensity that should've been uncomfortable but wasn't.

"What?" Ethan asked.

"Just memorizing this." Caleb's hand cupped his face. "In case I wake up and you're gone."

"I'm not going anywhere. Not tonight, anyway."

"And tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow I'll probably still be here, hogging your blankets and stealing your coffee."

"Promise?"

"Yeah." Ethan pressed his forehead to Caleb's. "I promise."

They fell asleep like that—tangled together, warm and safe, while rain whispered against the windows and the fire crackled below. Ethan dreamed of running through forests, of laughter and lantern light, of hands that held him steady when the world tilted sideways.

When he woke, dawn was breaking through the skylight, pale and soft. The rain had stopped. The air smelled clean and fresh, like the world had been washed new. Beside him, Caleb was still sleeping, one arm thrown across Ethan's waist, his face peaceful in the early light.

Ethan should probably feel panic—this was moving too fast, they hadn't figured anything out, he still didn't know if he was staying. But all he felt was peace. And maybe that was answer enough for now.

He eased out of bed carefully, not wanting to wake Caleb, and pulled on the sleep pants he'd discarded the night before. Downstairs, the fire had burned to embers, casting faint orange light across the floor. He poked it back to life, added a log, watched flames catch and grow.

Coffee. He could make coffee. That seemed like a safe, normal thing to do while he processed the fact that he'd just spent the night with his ex-boyfriend—ex-everything—and it had been perfect.

He found the coffee maker, the beans, filters. Moved around Caleb's kitchen like he'd done it a hundred times before. The familiarity of it settled something in his chest—this felt right. Not just the sex, though that had been spectacular, but this. Domestic quiet. Morning routine. The simple act of making coffee for someone he cared about.

"You're awake early."

Ethan turned to find Caleb descending the ladder, wearing just sleep pants that hung low on his hips. His hair was mussed, his eyes still soft with sleep, and Ethan's heart did that stupid fluttering thing again.

"Couldn't sleep," Ethan said. "Didn't want to wake you."

"I don't mind." Caleb crossed to him, pressed a kiss to his temple. "Coffee?"

"Almost ready."

"You're good at this."

"Making coffee?"

"Being here. In my space. Like you belong."

Ethan's breath caught. "Do I?"

"Yeah." Caleb's arms came around him from behind, solid and warm. "You do."

They stood like that—Ethan leaning back against Caleb's chest, watching coffee drip into the pot, morning light slowly filling the cabin. Through the window, the forest was washed clean, leaves gleaming, mist rising from wet earth.

"I should probably go back to the inn soon," Ethan said eventually. "Get cleaned up. Check my emails."

"You don't have to."

"I know. But if I don't, people will talk."

"Let them talk." Caleb's voice was warm against his ear. "We're in Maple Hollow. They're going to talk anyway."

"True." Ethan turned in his arms. "But I'd like to at least shower and change before becoming the morning's gossip."

"Fair enough." Caleb kissed him—slow and thorough. "But have coffee first. And breakfast. I actually can cook, despite what you remember."

"Yeah?"

"I'll prove it."

So Ethan stayed. They drank coffee at the small table by the window, watching morning light break through trees. Caleb made eggs—fluffy and perfectly seasoned this time—and toast with butter and jam Ruby had made. They ate and talked and laughed, and it felt so natural Ethan almost forgot to be scared.

Almost.

"What are you thinking?" Caleb asked, reading him too easily.

"That this is nice."

"But?"

"But I don't know what we're doing. What this is. What happens when the festival ends and I have to decide whether to stay or go."

Caleb was quiet for a moment. "What do you want it to be?"

"I don't know." Ethan's voice was small. "Something real. Not just nostalgia or convenience or—"

"It's real." Caleb reached across the table, took his hand. "Whatever else it is, it's real. I'm not pretending, Ethan. I'm not doing this because you're convenient or because I'm lonely. I'm doing this because I want you. Because I've always wanted you."

"Even after twelve years?"

"Especially after twelve years." Caleb's thumb traced circles on Ethan's palm. "I know we have things to figure out. I know it's complicated. But I also know I'd rather figure it out with you than without you."

Ethan's throat tightened. "I don't want to mess this up again."

"Then we won't. We'll talk, we'll be honest, we'll take it one day at a time." Caleb smiled. "And if it gets hard, we'll deal with it together instead of running away."

"Is that an alpha directive?"

"It's a promise." Caleb pulled him closer, kissed him gently. "I'm not letting you go without a fight this time. Fair warning."

"Noted." Ethan kissed him back. "For the record, I don't want to go."

"Then stay."

"It's not that simple."

"Why not?"

"Because—" Ethan stopped. Realized he didn't have a good answer. Because he was scared? Because he didn't know if he could build a life here? Because he still wasn't sure who he was when he wasn't running? None of those felt like good enough reasons anymore.

"Think about it," Caleb said softly. "No pressure. Just... think about what you want, not what you think you should want. And then tell me."

"Okay." Ethan squeezed his hand. "I can do that."

They finished breakfast in comfortable silence. Ethan helped clean up, falling easily into rhythm with Caleb—he washed, Caleb dried, their shoulders bumping occasionally, small smiles exchanged. When everything was put away, Caleb walked him to the door.

"I should go," Ethan said, though he made no move to leave.

"You should," Caleb agreed, though his hands found Ethan's hips, pulled him close.

"People will definitely talk if I show up at the inn wearing your clothes."

"You can keep them."

"That's not helping."

"I'm not trying to help." Caleb kissed him. "I'm trying to convince you to stay."

"You're very convincing." Ethan kissed him back. "But I really do need to go. Work. Responsibilities. Adulting."

"Fine." Caleb released him with obvious reluctance. "But come back? Later? I'll make dinner."

"Yeah." Ethan smiled. "I'd like that."

He made it two steps down the porch before turning back. Caleb was watching him, leaning against the doorframe, looking entirely too attractive for someone who'd just woken up.

"Caleb?"

"Yeah?"

"Last night—" Ethan paused. "It was good. Really good."

"Yeah it was."

"Just wanted you to know."

"Now I know." Caleb's smile was warm. "Go. Before I drag you back inside."

Ethan went, but he looked back three times before the cabin disappeared from view. Each time, Caleb was still there, watching him with an expression that made Ethan's chest ache in the best possible way.

The walk back to town was quiet. Morning mist clung to the ground, softening edges, making everything feel dreamlike. Birds called from the trees. Somewhere nearby, water dripped from leaves. The air smelled fresh and clean, like the storm had washed away more than just dust.

Ethan's borrowed clothes—Caleb's clothes—were soft and warm against his skin. His wet jeans and shirt were bundled under his arm, but he didn't care about the odd looks he'd get. Let them stare. Let them talk. He'd spent the night with Caleb Hawthorne, and he wasn't going to pretend otherwise.

His phone buzzed as he reached the main road. Ruby: *So... did the storm blow anything interesting your way?*

Ethan smiled, typed back: *You could say that.*

*Details?*

*Later.*

*You're wearing Caleb's sleep pants, aren't you? Mrs. Chen just texted me. You passed her shop.*

*This town is impossible.*

*This town is invested. Big difference. Also, I'm making you breakfast tomorrow so I can get all the details.*

*Deal.*

He pocketed his phone, shaking his head. Ruby was right—this town was impossible. But as he walked through morning-quiet streets, catching knowing looks and small smiles from early risers, Ethan found he didn't mind. For the first time in twelve years, he felt like he might actually belong here. Not despite being with Caleb, but because of it.

Maybe coming home didn't mean losing himself. Maybe it meant finally finding the parts of himself he'd left behind.

Ethan woke to find himself alone on the couch, wrapped in a blanket that smelled like cedar and smoke. Sunlight streamed through the cabin windows, bright and warm. Outside, he could hear the rhythmic *thunk* of wood being split.

He sat up slowly, scrubbing a hand through his hair. His borrowed clothes were rumpled, his body pleasantly sore in ways that made him smile. The fire had burned down to embers again, but the cabin was still warm.

Coffee steamed on the table beside him—two mugs, one clearly meant for him. Beside it, a note in Caleb's precise handwriting: *Stacking firewood. Didn't want to wake you. Coffee's fresh. Help yourself to anything in the kitchen.*

Ethan picked up the mug, inhaled the rich scent, and looked out the window. Through the glass he could see Caleb in the side yard, ax raised, bringing it down in a smooth arc that split a log cleanly. He was shirtless despite the cool morning air, muscles moving beneath tanned skin, a faint sheen of sweat catching the light.

Ethan's mouth went dry.

He watched for another minute—purely for research purposes, obviously—then got up and padded to the door. Stepped outside into morning air that was crisp and clean, carrying the scent of split wood and pine.

Caleb looked up as Ethan approached, his face breaking into a smile that did complicated things to Ethan's pulse.

"Morning," Caleb said. "Sleep okay?"

"Like the dead." Ethan gestured with his mug. "You made coffee."

"Had to. Otherwise you'd be grumpy."

"I'm not grumpy in the morning."

"You absolutely are." Caleb set down the ax, wiped his hands on his jeans. "You always were."

"That's—" Ethan paused. "Okay, that's fair."

Caleb laughed, warm and genuine, and crossed to him. Kissed him good morning like it was the most natural thing in the world, like they'd been doing this for years instead of hours.

"You're up early," Ethan said when they pulled apart. "Couldn't sleep?"

"Slept fine. Just had energy to burn." Caleb's smile turned knowing. "Good energy."

"Oh." Ethan felt heat rise in his cheeks. "Yeah. That makes sense."

"You're blushing."

"I am not."

"You definitely are." Caleb kissed him again, quick and teasing. "It's cute."

"I'm a serious journalist. I don't do cute."

"Sure you don't." Caleb turned back to the woodpile. "Want to help?"

"With chopping wood?" Ethan looked at the ax skeptically. "I'm more of an indoor cat."

"I remember." Caleb's tone was affectionate. "You can stack while I chop. Teamwork."

So Ethan did. They worked together in companionable silence—Caleb splitting logs with steady efficiency, Ethan stacking them against the cabin wall. It was simple, physical work that left no room for overthinking. Just the rhythm of their movements, the morning sun warming his skin, the occasional brush of their hands when Caleb passed him a fresh log.

Domestic, Ethan thought. Dangerously domestic.

"What are you thinking about?" Caleb asked, reading him again.

"How normal this feels."

"Is that bad?"

"No." Ethan stacked another log. "Just unexpected. I thought it would be weird, you know? The morning after. But it's not."

"Good weird or bad weird?"

"Good weird. Definitely good weird." Ethan glanced at him. "You're humming."

"I am?"

"Yeah. Under your breath. Some folk song."

Caleb paused, seemed to realize he *had* been humming. "Sorry. Habit."

"Don't apologize. I like it." Ethan smiled. "You always hummed when you were content. I'd forgotten that."

"You remember that?"

"I remember everything about you." Ethan echoed Caleb's words from the night before. "That's the problem."

"Is it?" Caleb set down the ax, moved closer. "Because from where I'm standing, remembering seems like a pretty good thing."

"Yeah." Ethan leaned into him. "It does."

They stood like that for a long moment—Caleb's arms around his waist, Ethan's head on his shoulder, morning sunlight filtering through trees. The world felt soft-edged and possible, like anything could happen from here.

"I should probably head back soon," Ethan said eventually. "For real this time."

"You don't have to."

"I know. But I should." He pulled back enough to meet Caleb's eyes. "Meet me later? At the Gazette office?"

"Yeah." Caleb smiled. "I can do that."

"Good." Ethan kissed him once more, then forced himself to step away before he changed his mind. "See you later?"

"Count on it."

Ethan walked back toward town with Caleb's flannel still over his shoulders, coffee warming his hands, and the taste of promise on his lips. Behind him, he heard the ax bite wood again, steady and sure. And beneath that, barely audible, Caleb's voice humming softly in the morning light.

Domestic. Dangerous. Perfect.

Maybe staying wasn't the terrifying prospect he'd built it up to be. Maybe it was exactly what he'd been looking for all along—not loss of self, but finding it. Not being consumed, but choosing connection. Not running, but finally, *finally* coming home.

The thought should've scared him. Instead, it felt like breathing after twelve years underwater.

Ethan smiled, pulled the flannel tighter, and headed toward whatever came next.
