# Chapter 6 – Late Shift Glow

The tavern smelled like cinnamon and applause, the kind that lingered after everyone else had gone home.

Caleb stood behind the bar, running a cloth over the worn oak surface in slow, methodical circles. The wood was warm beneath his hands, polished smooth by decades of similar motions—bartenders closing up, wiping away the evidence of celebration, preparing the space for tomorrow's needs. Outside, the festival continued in muted form—distant music from the square, occasional laughter from people walking home, the soft glow of lanterns painting the street in amber.

Inside the Wildwood Tavern, everything had settled into the particular quiet that came after a successful night. The opening ceremony had driven significant traffic through the bar—tourists looking for the "authentic local experience," pack members celebrating the festival's official start, townspeople seeking the comfort of familiar faces and familiar whiskey. Now the last patrons had filtered out into the October night, and only the work of closing remained.

"That was a good night," Jasper said from somewhere near the back booths, his voice carrying the satisfied exhaustion of someone who'd been moving constantly for six hours. "Best opening ceremony crowd in years. Whatever you and Ethan did up on that stage, it worked."

Caleb kept his attention on the bar top, working the cloth over a stubborn ring where someone's cider had sat too long. "We just read the script Vance gave us."

"Bullshit." Jasper appeared with an armful of empty glasses, setting them carefully in the sink. "You went off-script. I know, because half the people who came in here after couldn't stop talking about Ethan's little speech about homecoming and truth." He paused, examining Caleb with the particular attention that came from fifteen years of friendship. "They also couldn't stop talking about the way you were looking at him while he said it."

"I was standing next to him. Where else was I supposed to look?"

"Literally anywhere else." Jasper's grin was knowing but gentle. "But you didn't. And neither did he, before you try to deflect again."

Caleb didn't have a good response to that. Mostly because Jasper was right—Ethan's impromptu admission had caught him completely off guard, and he'd stood there on stage in front of the entire town unable to do anything except look at him and feel something dangerous and hopeful unfurling in his chest.

"It was a good ceremony," he said finally, which was both true and completely insufficient.

"It was a great ceremony." Jasper moved to start collecting glasses from the tables, his movements efficient from long practice. "It was also extremely obvious that you two still have feelings for each other. Which, for the record, no one is surprised by. The only people pretending there's nothing there are you and Ethan."

"We're working together professionally. For the festival."

"Right. Professionally." Jasper's tone suggested exactly how much he believed that. "And the way your entire body language changed when he walked on stage—that was professional Alpha body language. Very neutral. Extremely no-feelings-involved."

Caleb shot him a look. "Don't you have glasses to wash?"

"I'm multitasking. Washing glasses and calling you on your bullshit." But Jasper's expression was warm, his teasing edged with genuine affection. "Look, I'm not saying you need to do anything about it. I'm just saying—it's okay if you want to. The pack would survive you being happy, Cal. Might even thrive on it."

It was almost exactly what Nico had said last night on the bridge. The repetition made it harder to dismiss as well-meaning interference and more like something Caleb actually needed to hear.

"Noted," he said, which was as close to acknowledgment as he could manage.

They worked in comfortable silence for several minutes, falling into the familiar rhythm of closing duties. Caleb finished the bar while Jasper handled the floor—collecting glasses, wiping tables, straightening chairs. The work was meditative, required no conversation, let Caleb's mind drift without demanding direction.

It kept drifting back to the stage. To Ethan standing close enough that Caleb could smell him—cedar and rain and old-book-pages. To the way Ethan's voice had caught on certain words. To the moment when their eyes had met and something had passed between them that had nothing to do with festival logistics and everything to do with twelve years of unresolved history.

To the way Ethan had looked at him after they'd left the stage, standing in that small pocket of space near the bookstore. The openness in his expression, the vulnerability. *The thing I said. About coming home. I meant it.*

Caleb believed him. That was the dangerous part.

A knock at the front door pulled him from his thoughts. They'd turned the sign to "Closed" twenty minutes ago, but late arrivals weren't uncommon during festival week. Caleb glanced at Jasper, who shrugged and continued clearing tables.

"Your bar," Jasper said. "Your call whether we're actually closed or just closed-adjacent."

Caleb moved to the door, already prepared to politely redirect whoever it was to tomorrow's opening hours. Then he saw who was standing on the other side of the glass.

Ethan.

He stood under the tavern's porch light, hands shoved in his jacket pockets, that familiar expression of studied casualness that suggested he was trying very hard to seem like this was spontaneous rather than deliberate. His hair was windblown, his cheeks slightly flushed from cold or nerves or possibly both.

Caleb's wolf, which had been relatively quiet since the ceremony ended, stirred with interest.

He unlocked the door and pulled it open. Cold air rushed in, carrying the scent of autumn and woodsmoke and Ethan.

"Hey," Ethan said. "Sorry, I know you're closed. I can come back tomorrow if—"

"It's fine." Caleb stepped back, gesturing him inside. "Come in before all our heat escapes."

Ethan crossed the threshold, and Caleb locked the door again behind him. The tavern felt different suddenly—smaller, more intimate, charged with the particular electricity that came from proximity and possibility.

"I was just—" Ethan started, then seemed to recalibrate. "Okay, truthfully, I was walking home and saw your lights still on and thought maybe I could get a quote. For the article. About tonight's ceremony, community response, that kind of thing."

It was a terrible excuse. They both knew it.

"A quote," Caleb repeated.

"Journalistic integrity requires multiple sources," Ethan said, his tone light but his eyes serious. "And you're the Alpha. Official voice of the pack and all that."

"Right." Caleb was trying very hard not to smile. "Official voice."

From somewhere near the back booth, Jasper called out: "Oh good, we have company. Perfect timing. I was just about to abandon Cal to close up alone while I go home and sleep for twelve hours."

Ethan's attention shifted past Caleb. "Hey, Jasper. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt closing."

"You didn't interrupt anything." Jasper appeared with the last armful of glasses, his expression radiating innocence that wasn't remotely convincing. "Cal was just wiping things down very intensely and pretending he wasn't replaying tonight's ceremony in his head. Your timing is impeccable, actually. Gives him something better to focus on than his own thoughts."

"Jasper—" Caleb started.

"I'm leaving. See? Already leaving." Jasper set the glasses in the sink, grabbed his jacket from the hook by the back door. "Ethan, good to see you. Cal, don't forget to lock up when you're done with your very professional interview about official pack business."

He was out the back door before Caleb could formulate a response, leaving them alone in the warm glow of the tavern's ambient lighting.

The silence stretched. Not uncomfortable, exactly, but weighted with awareness. They were alone. Actually alone, for the first time since Ethan had returned to town. No crowd, no ceremony, no official responsibilities to hide behind.

"So," Ethan said. "That was subtle."

"Jasper doesn't do subtle." Caleb moved back behind the bar, needing something to do with his hands. "But he means well."

"He thinks we're—" Ethan gestured vaguely between them, his journalist's precision failing him. "—something."

"The whole town thinks we're something." Caleb started filling the sink with hot water, adding soap. "They've been thinking it since you walked into the square two days ago. Maybe before that."

"And what do you think?"

The question landed with more weight than its simple construction suggested. Caleb's hands stilled in the water.

What did he think?

He thought Ethan looked good standing in his tavern, windblown and slightly nervous and trying to pretend this was about work when they both knew it wasn't. He thought the way Ethan had gone off-script tonight, speaking from obvious sincerity about homecoming and truth, had been either incredibly brave or incredibly reckless or possibly both. He thought having Ethan this close, in his space, smelling like cold air and possibility, made it very hard to remember all the reasons he'd spent eight years keeping this particular want carefully contained.

"I think," Caleb said carefully, "that it's late, and you probably didn't walk all the way here just for a quote."

Ethan's expression shifted—something between relief and apprehension. "No," he admitted. "I didn't."

"So why did you come?"

"Honestly?" Ethan pulled off his jacket, hanging it on the back of a barstool. "I don't entirely know. I was walking home, and then I saw your lights, and I just—wanted to be here. With you. Without the crowd and the ceremony and the whole town watching." He paused. "Is that okay?"

Something in Caleb's chest loosened at the directness of it. No deflection, no journalist's careful phrasing. Just honest want, offered without apology.

"Yeah," he said. "That's okay."

Ethan's smile was small but genuine. "Good. Because I probably would have felt extremely awkward if you'd said no."

"You feel awkward anyway," Caleb observed.

"True." Ethan moved to lean against the bar, mirroring Caleb's position from the other side. "But I'm choosing to interpret your allowing me to stay as tacit approval of my awkwardness."

"Very journalistic of you."

"I contain multitudes." Ethan watched him for a moment, his expression thoughtful. "Can I help? With the closing stuff?"

The offer surprised Caleb, though maybe it shouldn't have. Ethan had worked at this bar briefly in high school, back when his father was still alive and money was tight and every teenager in Maple Hollow cycled through part-time work at local businesses. He'd know the routines.

"You don't have to—"

"I know." Ethan was already moving around the bar, joining him on the business side. "But if I'm going to interrupt your closing routine, I should at least make myself useful."

He grabbed a towel and started drying the glasses Jasper had left in the dish rack. The motion was automatic, muscle memory from years ago, and something about seeing him fall into the familiar rhythm made the tavern feel simultaneously more and less complicated.

They worked in silence for a few minutes. Caleb washed, Ethan dried. The hot water was soothing, the task mindless enough to be meditative. Steam rose between them, softening the edges of everything.

"Tonight was good," Ethan said eventually. "The ceremony. You were—" He paused, searching for words. "—really good. Natural. Like you've been doing this forever."

"I have been doing this. Eight years of welcome ceremonies."

"That's not what I meant." Ethan set a dried glass carefully on the shelf. "I meant you seemed comfortable. In your role, in your skin. Like you'd grown into something you were always meant to be." Another pause. "It was good to see."

The compliment settled warm in Caleb's chest. "You were pretty good yourself. That bit about measuring time in cinnamon and moonlight—where'd that come from?"

"Desperation and too much coffee." Ethan's grin was self-deprecating. "I'd been stressing about what to say all day. Ruby kept telling me to just speak from the heart, which is terrible advice because my heart wanted to stand up there and blurt out extremely inappropriate things about—" He caught himself. "—about the town. The town's magic. Very professional nostalgia."

Caleb heard what Ethan hadn't said. Heard it in the slight catch in his voice, the way his hands stilled on the glass he was drying.

"The off-script part," Caleb said. "About coming home. That was—" He searched for the right word. "—brave."

"It was stupid."

"It was honest."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive." But Ethan was smiling slightly, his guard lowering in increments. "I didn't plan it. It just came out. And then the whole town applauded, and I realized I'd just admitted my feelings about Maple Hollow to several hundred witnesses."

"Not just about Maple Hollow," Caleb said quietly.

Ethan's gaze met his. Held. The steam from the sink drifted between them.

"No," Ethan admitted. "Not just about Maple Hollow."

The acknowledgment hung in the air between them, delicate and significant. Neither of them moved to clarify it, to name what they were actually talking about. But the meaning was clear enough.

Caleb returned his attention to the dishes, needing the distraction. "Ruby recorded the whole thing. She's probably already edited it into something extremely sentimental for her podcast."

"Oh god, she definitely has." Ethan groaned. "She cornered me after and showed me three minutes of footage that was just us standing way too close while delivering perfectly innocent festival logistics. She captioned it 'The Homecoming Energy Is Palpable.'"

"That sounds like Ruby."

"The worst part is she's not wrong." Ethan was drying glasses again, his movements careful. "It is palpable. Whatever this is—" He gestured vaguely between them with the towel. "—everyone can see it."

"Does that bother you?"

"I don't know." Ethan's honesty was disarming. "Part of me wants to maintain professional distance, pretend this is just a work assignment. But the other part—the bigger part—knows that's impossible. You can't come home and pretend you're a stranger. You can't stand next to someone you used to—" He stopped himself again. "—someone you used to know, and act like they're just another source for your article."

Caleb finished the last glass, drained the sink. The water swirled away, leaving just the faint scent of lemon soap and warmth. He dried his hands carefully, needing the extra seconds to compose his thoughts.

"What do you want, Ethan?" The question came out quieter than he'd intended, but he didn't take it back.

Ethan set down the glass he'd been drying, turning to face Caleb fully. They were close now—closer than necessary, separated by maybe a foot of space that felt both vast and nonexistent.

"I don't know," Ethan said, and the admission sounded like it cost him. "I came back here thinking I could just do the assignment and leave. Document the festival, write the feature, maybe get some closure on this place." He paused. "But two days in, and I'm already realizing that's not possible. Being here—being around you—it's making me remember things I thought I'd moved past."

"Like what?"

"Like how it felt to belong somewhere. To be part of something instead of just observing it." Ethan's voice had gone softer. "Like how easy it was to talk to you. How you always made me feel—" He struggled with the phrasing. "—seen. Not just looked at, but actually seen."

Caleb's wolf was very interested in where this was going. Was pressing forward with want and recognition and the particular certainty that came from instinct rather than logic.

"That's a dangerous thing to tell me," Caleb said.

"I know." Ethan's smile was rueful. "But you asked what I wanted, and I'm trying to be honest. Even if it's complicated."

They stood there in the warm tavern quiet, the festival continuing outside without them. Steam from the sink still drifted between them, softening edges, making everything feel slightly dreamlike.

Caleb could smell him. Could sense his heartbeat, slightly elevated. Could feel the pull between them like gravity or instinct or twelve years of unfinished conversation finally finding voice.

This was the moment. The space where he could either maintain distance or close it. Where he could choose duty over desire, or finally—finally—let himself want something for reasons that had nothing to do with pack welfare or community responsibility.

Nico's voice in his head: *You're allowed to want things.*

Jasper's observation: *The pack would survive you being happy.*

Mara's knowing smile when she'd mentioned the moon's pull.

Everyone around him had been giving him permission. The question was whether he could give it to himself.

"Ethan—"

A sound from outside interrupted—voices on the street, people passing by on their way home from whatever festival activities had kept them out late. The moment fractured, reality reasserting itself.

Ethan stepped back, putting distance between them that felt both necessary and disappointing. "I should go," he said. "Let you finish closing up. You probably have Alpha things to do tomorrow morning, and I've already interrupted your night."

"You didn't interrupt." Caleb heard himself say it, heard the honesty in his own voice. "I'm glad you came by."

"Yeah?" Ethan's expression was hopeful in a way that made him look younger, less guarded.

"Yeah."

They stood there for another beat, neither quite ready to end the moment but both aware it needed to end. The tavern had been cleaned. The glasses were dried and shelved. There was no practical reason for Ethan to stay, and every emotional reason for him to go before they said or did something that couldn't be easily walked back.

"Tomorrow," Ethan said. "Coffee. We said nine at Ruby's, right?"

"Right." Caleb had actually forgotten about that plan, made in the chaos after the ceremony. Now it felt like the most important appointment on his calendar.

"Okay." Ethan grabbed his jacket, shrugging it on. "I'll see you then."

He moved toward the door, and Caleb followed to unlock it. Their hands brushed on the door handle—brief contact, skin against skin, lasting maybe a second. Not quite intentional, not quite accidental.

Ethan's breath caught. Just slightly, just enough that Caleb heard it.

"Goodnight, Cal," Ethan said quietly.

"Goodnight."

Ethan stepped out into the October night, pulling his jacket tighter against the cold. He turned back once, meeting Caleb's eyes through the glass.

Then he smiled—small and genuine and complicated—and walked away down the lamp-lit street.

Caleb stood in the doorway for a long moment, watching him go. The festival lanterns cast everything in amber and gold. The moon hung high and bright, three-quarters full and waxing toward harvest. The air smelled like woodsmoke and promise.

Above him, the tavern's porch light flickered—brief and bright, like punctuation.

Caleb looked up at it, then back toward where Ethan had disappeared around the corner.

The town was meddling. The magic was cooperating. His pack was giving permission. And Ethan—Ethan was back, and honest, and standing close enough to make Caleb remember what it felt like to want something beyond duty.

He went back inside, locked the door, finished the last of the closing tasks. But his mind was already on tomorrow morning. On coffee at Ruby's place. On whatever conversation they'd have without crowds or ceremonies or official responsibilities to hide behind.

On the possibility—terrifying and exhilarating—that maybe some things weren't actually finished. That maybe what he'd spent twelve years trying to move past was actually something he needed to move toward.

The moon watched through the tavern windows, patient and knowing.

Caleb turned off the lights and headed home, his wolf settled and content in a way it hadn't been in years.

Outside, the lanterns burned steady. Inside, something had shifted—subtle but significant, like the first crack in ice before spring.

Tomorrow, he thought. They'd figure it out tomorrow.

Tonight, for the first time in a long time, that felt like enough.
