# Chapter 10 – Words on Fire

The Gazette smelled like wet paper and regret.

Caleb pushed through the front door mid-morning, intending to surprise Ethan with coffee and maybe steal a few minutes of unscheduled time before his afternoon patrol. He'd woken that morning with Ethan still asleep beside him, face soft in the early light, one hand curled against Caleb's chest. He'd watched him for a long moment before forcing himself out of bed to chop wood—anything to burn off the restless, joyful energy that came from finally, *finally* having what he'd wanted for twelve years.

The night before—*this morning*, really—still hummed beneath his skin. The taste of Ethan's mouth. The weight of his body. The way he'd laughed, soft and unguarded, when Caleb kissed the curve of his shoulder. The vulnerable honesty in his eyes when he'd said, "I want this. I want you."

Domestic. Dangerous. His.

The coffee cups in Caleb's hands were still warm, bought from the Morning Brew with an extra shot of espresso in Ethan's because the man was useless before ten a.m. Caleb had even grabbed one of those ridiculous maple scones Ethan loved, the ones with too much icing that somehow always ended up on his fingers.

He'd been smiling when he reached for the door handle.

But the moment Caleb stepped inside, he knew something was wrong.

The newsroom—usually a chaotic hum of typing and phone calls—had gone silent. Not the comfortable quiet of concentration, but the strained hush of people trying very hard not to look at something they desperately wanted to see.

Ruby stood near the layout desk, arms crossed, her face pale. She'd been crying—Caleb could see the smudged mascara at the corners of her eyes, the way she kept swallowing like her throat was tight. Marcus from the print shop hovered by the copier, looking like he wanted to disappear through the wall. His hands twisted a rag over and over, leaving ink stains on his fingers.

And Ethan sat at his desk in the corner, head in his hands, shoulders tight with tension. His laptop was open in front of him, screen dark. Papers were scattered across the surface—notes, drafts, scribbled interview questions. The flannel shirt Caleb had lent him this morning lay draped over the back of his chair, and somehow that small detail hurt more than anything else.

The coffee Caleb had brought suddenly felt too heavy in his grip.

"What happened?" he asked.

Ruby's gaze flicked to him, then to Ethan. "You should ask him."

Ethan looked up. His eyes were red-rimmed, jaw clenched so hard Caleb could see the muscle jumping. "Caleb. I didn't think you'd—"

"What's going on?" Caleb moved deeper into the room, setting the coffee down on Ruby's desk. The air smelled wrong. Sharp. Acrid. Like something burning.

Ruby reached for a printout on the desk and held it out to him. Her hand shook slightly. "This showed up on the community board at the co-op an hour ago. Someone printed twenty copies and posted them around town. The coffee shop. The library. The community center. Everywhere."

Caleb took the paper. The ink was still fresh, slightly smudged at the edges. His eyes caught the headline first.

**HARVEST MOON MYSTERY: Emotional Surge Tied to Lunar Cycle?**
*By Ethan Cross*

Then the subheading: *Is Pack Magic Destabilizing Maple Hollow's Emotional Climate?*

His stomach dropped.

He skimmed the article. It was careful—tentative, even—full of speculation rather than accusation. But the details were there: unexplained emotional outbursts over the past two weeks, ward ribbons fraying faster than usual despite regular maintenance, anecdotal reports of heightened anger and desire that seemed to align with the full moon's approach. There were quotes from unnamed sources describing sudden tears, inexplicable rage, attraction that felt foreign and overwhelming.

Theories about pack magic interacting with lunar phases. Questions about whether the town's supernatural residents were responsible for destabilizing public safety. Speculation about how shifter emotions might "leak" into the general population during times of heightened lunar activity.

And at the bottom, a note in brackets: *[DRAFT - NOT FOR PUBLICATION - PENDING INTERVIEWS]*

It wasn't an attack. Ethan had been fair, balanced even, leaving room for alternative explanations. He'd written it like someone genuinely trying to understand a phenomenon, not expose a scandal.

But it felt like exposure anyway. Like being stripped bare in front of the entire town.

Because buried in the careful journalism were truths Caleb had been trying to protect. Details only someone close to the pack would know. The specific pattern of ward degradation. The timing of emotional surges that aligned perfectly with Caleb's own struggles to maintain control. The way certain pack members had been avoiding public spaces because they couldn't trust their own reactions.

Someone reading this wouldn't just see a story about supernatural phenomena. They'd see his pack as a threat. As something to be feared, studied, possibly controlled.

And they'd be looking at him for answers.

"Did you write this?" Caleb asked quietly. His voice came out steadier than he felt.

Ethan stood, hands shaking as he crossed to him. Up close, Caleb could see the exhaustion in his face, the way his eyes kept darting to the printout like it might catch fire. "It's not finished. It wasn't meant to be seen."

"But you wrote it."

"I was trying to understand what's happening here." Ethan's voice cracked slightly. "The emotional surges, the wards, the way people have been acting. I thought if I could document the pattern, maybe we could figure out—"

"We?" Caleb interrupted. "Or you?"

Ethan flinched. "Both. I was going to show you. That's why I wanted to meet at the office today."

"Before or after you saved it to a shared drive that half the town has access to?"

"I didn't think—" Ethan stopped, jaw clenching. "I made a mistake. I should've been more careful."

Caleb's jaw tightened. He read the article again, slower this time, seeing the unfinished edges. The places where Ethan had clearly intended to add context, nuance, balance. Bracketed notes to himself: *[get Caleb's perspective here]* and *[need to explain pack dynamics more clearly]* and *[make sure this doesn't sound accusatory]*.

Those gaps didn't matter now. Someone had taken this draft and weaponized it.

"How did it get out?" he asked, keeping his voice level. The wolf in him wanted to prowl, to pace, to find whoever had done this and make them answer for it. But that wouldn't help Ethan. Wouldn't help his pack.

"I don't know." Ethan's voice was hollow. "I saved it to the shared drive last night before I left to meet you at the cabin. It was late, I was distracted, I just—I didn't think anyone would look at it. It was clearly marked as a draft."

"The shared drive?" Ruby cut in, her tone sharp with frustration. "Ethan, anyone with access to the Gazette network can see that. We've been over this."

"I know that *now*." Ethan's hands curled into fists. "I wasn't thinking about security protocols. I was thinking about—" He stopped, glancing at Caleb. "I was thinking about other things."

About me, Caleb realized. About last night. About everything they'd finally said to each other after twelve years of silence.

The irony wasn't lost on him. The night they'd finally let their guard down was the night everything had fallen apart.

"Who else has access?" Caleb asked, forcing himself to focus on logistics instead of the ache spreading through his chest.

Ruby counted on her fingers. "Me, Ethan, Marcus, the two freelancers—Jenny and Tom—and anyone with the guest login. Which is basically anyone who's ever needed to submit a community announcement or check the archives."

"So half the town," Caleb said flatly.

"Give or take." Ruby's expression was grim. "The system isn't exactly secure. We've been meaning to upgrade, but budget constraints—" She shook her head. "It doesn't matter now. Someone accessed the file, printed it, and distributed it. The question is who. And why."

Caleb thought about that. About who might want to stir up trouble between the pack and the rest of Maple Hollow. About who would benefit from fear and suspicion. The list wasn't long, but it wasn't empty either.

"Has anyone called claiming responsibility?" he asked.

"No." Ruby pulled out her phone, scrolling through messages. "But I've gotten about fifty texts in the last hour. Most people want to know if it's true. If the pack is really making them feel things they wouldn't normally feel. A few are angry. A couple are scared."

"And the rest?"

"Curious." Ruby's mouth twisted. "You know this town. Everyone loves a mystery."

Caleb exhaled slowly, forcing his pulse to steady. The wolf in him wanted to track down whoever leaked this and make them regret it. Wanted to protect, to defend, to fix this mess before it tore his pack apart. But that wouldn't help. Not now. Not when the damage was already done.

"People are already talking," Ruby said quietly, breaking the tense silence. "Mrs. Chen called me twenty minutes ago asking if the pack is 'making people feel things.' Mr. Okoye wants to know if the emotional surges are dangerous. And Mayor Vance just texted saying we need to do damage control before tonight's festival prep meeting."

Of course. Of course this would happen three days before the Harvest Moon Festival. Three days before the full moon when every shifter in town would be at their most volatile, their most visible. When the wards were already strained and the town's supernatural residents were hanging on by a thread.

Perfect timing.

Caleb looked at Ethan. Really looked at him. Saw the guilt written across his face, the way his shoulders hunched like he was trying to make himself smaller. Saw the exhaustion and fear and something else—something that looked like grief.

"You should've told me you were writing this," Caleb said, and his voice came out rougher than he intended. Not angry, exactly. Just… hurt.

"I tried to," Ethan said. "That's why I wanted to meet today. I was going to show you the draft and ask for your feedback before I went any further. I wanted your input. Your perspective."

"But you didn't."

"I didn't get the chance."

"You had plenty of chances." The words came out sharper than Caleb intended, but he couldn't stop them. Couldn't hold back the hurt that had been building since he'd read that headline. "Last night. This morning. You could've mentioned it when we were lying in bed together, or when I made you coffee, or when we stood in my yard talking about how normal everything felt."

"Don't." Ethan's voice was low, wounded. "Don't use that against me."

"I'm not—" Caleb stopped, closed his eyes. Tried to find his center, the calm that usually came so easily to him as Alpha. But it wasn't there. Just raw, bleeding hurt and the sharp edge of betrayal. "I trusted you."

"You can still trust me."

"Can I?" Caleb held up the printout, the paper crinkling in his grip. "Because this looks like you were gathering evidence for a story. Not trying to understand. Not trying to help. Just… looking for something to write about. Looking for the angle that would make it newsworthy."

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Caleb's voice stayed quiet, controlled, but the hurt bled through anyway. Every word felt like pulling something sharp from his chest. "You're a journalist, Ethan. This is what you do. You find stories. You expose secrets. You dig until you find the truth, and then you publish it for everyone to see. And I—"

He stopped himself, jaw clenching hard enough to hurt. Because he'd been about to say something he couldn't take back. Something about how he'd been an idiot to think Ethan would see him as anything other than material. How he'd let himself believe, just for a moment, that what they had was separate from the story. That Caleb could be more than just the Alpha of Maple Hollow, more than a source to be interviewed and quoted.

That he could just be Cal. The man Ethan used to love.

But maybe that was the problem. Maybe Ethan didn't love him anymore. Maybe he never really had. Maybe it had always been about the story—twelve years ago when Ethan was researching small-town life for his journalism degree, and now when he was researching supernatural phenomena for whatever came next in his career.

Maybe Caleb had always just been research.

Ethan flinched like he'd been struck. His face went pale, then flushed with color. "You know that's not true."

"Do I?"

"Yes." Ethan's voice shook, but there was steel underneath. "Because if you really believed that, you wouldn't have let me back into your life. You wouldn't have taken me on patrol, or brought me to your cabin, or—" His voice cracked. "You wouldn't have made love to me last night like I was something precious. Something worth keeping."

The words hit Caleb square in the chest. Made it hard to breathe.

"I didn't come back to Maple Hollow for a story," Ethan continued, taking a step closer. "I came back because I was tired of running. Because this place—these people—you—you've always been home, even when I was too scared to admit it. And yes, I wrote that article. Because that's what I do when I don't understand something. I write about it. I try to make sense of it. But I wasn't writing about you, Caleb. I was writing about a phenomenon that's affecting everyone in this town, including you. Including us."

"There is no us if I can't trust you," Caleb said, and he hated how final it sounded. How much it hurt to say.

Ethan's eyes filled with tears he didn't shed. "Then I guess we have a problem."

The silence stretched between them, heavy and wrong. Caleb could feel Ruby and Marcus watching from their careful distance, could sense the tension coiling tighter with every second. He needed to leave. Needed space to think, to breathe, to figure out how to protect his pack when the man he'd just opened himself to had inadvertently painted a target on all of them.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Once, twice, three times. Probably pack members wanting answers he didn't have. Or townspeople wanting assurance he couldn't give.

But before he could move, before he could force himself to walk out that door and away from Ethan's wounded eyes, the front door opened and Mayor Vance swept in.

She was a small woman, barely five feet tall, with silver hair pulled into a neat bun and eyes that missed nothing. She wore a wool coat despite the mild weather and carried herself with the authority of someone who'd been managing supernatural politics since before Caleb was born. She'd been mayor for thirty years, had seen three generations of Hawthornes lead the pack, and had a reputation for cutting through bullshit with surgical precision.

Right now, her expression said she was about to perform surgery.

"Caleb. Ethan." She nodded to each of them in turn, her gaze sharp and assessing. Then, to Ruby and Marcus: "Give us the room, please."

They fled. Ruby shot Ethan one last worried glance before disappearing into the back office, Marcus close behind her.

Mayor Vance set her bag down on Ruby's desk with a decisive thud that made both Caleb and Ethan flinch. "I assume you've seen the article."

"We've seen it," Caleb said, his voice coming out rougher than intended.

"Good. Then you'll understand why we need an emergency meeting." She pulled off her coat, draped it over a chair with careful precision. "Tonight. Seven o'clock. Town hall. Every pack member and anyone else who wants answers. Which, judging by my phone—" She held up her cell, the screen lit up with notifications. "—is approximately everyone in Maple Hollow."

"Mayor, I don't think—" Ethan started.

"This isn't up for discussion, Mr. Cross." Her tone was firm but not unkind. Almost gentle, actually. Like she was talking to a skittish animal. "That article—finished or not, leaked or not—has people asking questions. Questions that deserve answers. We can either control the narrative or let fear do it for us. I prefer the former."

She moved to the window, looked out at the street where people were going about their morning business. But Caleb could see the undercurrent of tension even from here. Clusters of people talking in low voices. Glances toward the Gazette office. Mrs. Chen standing outside her shop with her phone pressed to her ear, her face worried.

"Fear is a fire," Mayor Vance said quietly. "It starts small—a spark, a whisper. But if you don't tend to it, if you let it smolder… it burns everything down."

Caleb's chest tightened. "What do you want me to say?"

"The truth." Mayor Vance turned back to face him, and her expression had softened. "Or as much of it as you're comfortable sharing. The Harvest Moon is affecting people. Denying it won't help. But neither will secrecy."

"And if people panic?"

"Then we manage it together." She glanced between him and Ethan. "All of us."

"With all due respect, Mayor," Caleb said carefully, "I'm not sure 'together' is an option right now."

"Then make it one." Her voice was sharp again, brooking no argument. "Because this town doesn't have the luxury of your personal drama. Not now. Not when we're three days from the full moon and people are already frightened."

Ethan made a soft sound of protest, but Mayor Vance held up a hand.

"I'm not diminishing your feelings," she said, gentler now. "Either of you. What happened here is a betrayal of trust, and that matters. But right now, there are two hundred families in this town who are scared. Who think the pack might be making them feel things they don't want to feel. Who are wondering if their neighbor might be dangerous. And if we don't address that fear, if we let it grow unchecked, we'll have a real crisis on our hands."

She was right. Caleb knew she was right. But knowing didn't make it easier to stand in the same room as Ethan, to pretend everything was fine when his chest felt like it was caving in.

"What do you need from me?" he asked finally.

"Honesty. Leadership. And enough grace to work with Mr. Cross to craft a message that will calm people down without exposing pack secrets that need to stay secret."

Caleb's jaw clenched. "You want us to work together."

"I want you to save this town from tearing itself apart." Mayor Vance's eyes were steady, unflinching. "And if that means putting aside your hurt feelings for a few hours, then yes. That's exactly what I want."

Ethan looked like he wanted to say something—maybe apologize, maybe defend himself—but the words seemed to catch in his throat. He just stood there, hands clenched at his sides, looking more lost than Caleb had ever seen him. Even twelve years ago, when Ethan had been packing his bags to leave, he'd at least had direction. Purpose. Now he just looked… broken.

"I'll be there," Caleb said finally, forcing the words out. "Seven o'clock."

"Good." Mayor Vance picked up her bag, paused at the door. "And Caleb? It's not truth that hurts us. It's timing. Remember that."

The words hung in the air long after she'd left, the door clicking shut behind her with a finality that made Caleb's chest ache.

Ruby cleared her throat from the doorway of the back office. She'd obviously been listening. "I'm going to give you two some space." She nudged Marcus toward the exit. "Come on. We'll work from the coffee shop for a bit."

"But—" Marcus started.

"Coffee shop. Now."

They left, and within seconds, Caleb and Ethan were alone in the newsroom. The silence felt like a living thing—thick and heavy and wrong. Outside, the town continued its daily rhythm. Cars driving past. Voices drifting through the window. The distant sound of someone's laughter.

It all felt impossibly far away.

"Caleb," Ethan said quietly, breaking the silence. "I'm sorry."

"For what?" Caleb kept his voice even, neutral. "For writing the article? For not telling me? For saving it somewhere anyone could find it? Or for getting caught?"

Ethan flinched. "All of it. None of it. I don't—" He ran a hand through his hair, the gesture frustrated and weary. "I don't know what you want me to say."

"I want you to tell me why." Caleb turned to face him fully. "Why you wrote it. Why you didn't come to me first. Why you thought documenting my pack's private struggles was more important than—"

He stopped. Couldn't finish that sentence. Because finishing it meant admitting how much he'd hoped for. How much he'd let himself want.

"More important than what?" Ethan asked softly. "Than us?"

"There is no us if I can't trust you."

"You can trust me." Ethan's voice broke on the words. "Caleb, I swear, I was going to show you. I was going to ask for your help. I never meant for anyone else to see it."

"But they did." Caleb gestured to the printout still lying on the desk. "And now my pack is exposed. People are scared. And I have to stand in front of the entire town tonight and try to convince them that we're not dangerous. That we're not making them feel things they don't want to feel."

"Are you?" Ethan asked. "Making them feel things?"

The question landed like a punch. Because yes, in a way, they were. Not intentionally. Not maliciously. But the Harvest Moon amplified everything—joy, fear, anger, desire. And when a whole pack of shifters was struggling to maintain control, that emotional energy had to go somewhere.

The wards helped. But they weren't perfect.

"It's complicated," Caleb said.

"Then help me understand." Ethan took a step closer. "That's all I was trying to do with the article. Understand. Because I've been feeling things too, Caleb. Things I can't explain. Emotions that don't feel entirely mine. And I thought—I hoped—that if I could figure out what was happening, maybe I could help."

"You don't get to help by exposing us."

"I wasn't exposing you. I was trying to find the truth."

"The truth isn't always meant to be shared," Caleb said, and his voice came out harsher than he intended. "Some things need to stay private. For everyone's protection."

"Including yours?"

"Especially mine." The admission cost him something. "I'm the Alpha, Ethan. If people lose faith in my ability to control the pack, to keep them safe, then everything falls apart. The wards, the festival, the entire balance we've maintained for decades. It all depends on people trusting me."

"And you think they won't trust you because of what I wrote?"

"I think they'll be afraid." Caleb's voice was quiet now, tired. "And fear makes people do stupid things."

Ethan's face crumpled. "I'm so sorry."

"I know." And he did. Could see it written in every line of Ethan's body, every tremor in his voice. "But sorry doesn't fix this."

"Then what does?"

Caleb didn't have an answer. Just looked at Ethan—at the man he'd loved for twelve years, lost for twelve years, and found again only to lose a second time—and felt something in his chest crack clean through.

"I don't know," he said finally. "I need to go."

"Caleb, please—"

"I'll see you tonight. At the meeting." He picked up the printout, folded it carefully, and tucked it into his jacket pocket. Evidence. Or maybe just a reminder of how quickly everything could fall apart. "We'll figure out what to say to the town. But after that…"

He couldn't finish. Didn't know how to.

"After that?" Ethan prompted, his voice barely above a whisper.

"I need time," Caleb said. "To think. To figure out if we can come back from this."

"Can we?"

Caleb looked at him. Really looked. Saw the hope and fear and desperate love in Ethan's eyes. Saw the man who'd run twelve years ago because he was scared of losing himself. The man who'd come back because he was tired of running. The man who'd spent last night in Caleb's arms, vulnerable and open and finally, finally home.

And he wanted to say yes. Wanted to forgive him right here, right now, and forget the article ever existed. Wanted to believe that love was enough to overcome betrayal.

But he was the Alpha. And his pack came first. Always.

"I don't know," he said honestly. And then, because he owed Ethan at least this much: "I want to. But I don't know."

He turned and walked toward the door, forcing himself not to look back. If he looked back, he'd see the hurt in Ethan's eyes, and if he saw that, he'd break. He'd forgive him before he was ready, before he'd had time to think about what forgiveness meant when the stakes were this high.

So he kept walking. Out the door, into sunlight that felt too bright, too harsh. Like the world was overexposed, every shadow too sharp, every color too saturated.

His phone buzzed incessantly in his pocket. Pack members needing reassurance. Townspeople wanting answers. The weight of it all pressed down on his shoulders, familiar and crushing.

He walked without direction, feet carrying him toward the bridge at the edge of town. The place where he and Ethan had first reconnected during patrol. Where the wards glowed softly at night, holding back the worst of the emotional surges. Where everything had started to feel possible again.

The river flowed beneath, steady and indifferent to human—or shifter—drama. The sound of it usually calmed him. Today it just made him feel more alone.

One of the ward ribbons had snapped loose.

Caleb stopped, staring at it. The ribbon hung limp against the railing, frayed at the edges, the sigil barely visible. He reached for it, running his thumb over the damaged thread. The ward was still active—he could feel the faint hum of magic beneath his fingertips—but it was weakening. Dying.

Just like everything else.

He tied the ribbon back in place with careful hands, reinforcing the knot the way his father had taught him. The way he'd taught the younger pack members. The motion was automatic, soothing in its familiarity. Loop, pull, tighten. Check the sigil, make sure the magic was flowing properly.

It wouldn't hold forever. None of them would. The Harvest Moon was coming, and when it rose, the wards would either hold or they wouldn't. His pack would either maintain control or they wouldn't. The town would either trust him or they wouldn't.

And Ethan…

Caleb closed his eyes, let the morning sun warm his face. Tried to find the calm he'd felt just hours ago, standing in his yard with Ethan beside him, stacking firewood in comfortable silence. That moment of perfect domesticity before everything fell apart.

*Domestic. Dangerous. Perfect.*

Ethan had thought the same thing. Caleb had seen it in his eyes, in the soft smile he'd worn while watching Caleb work. They'd both felt it—that dangerous possibility of happiness. Of building something real together.

And now…

Now Caleb didn't know if that possibility still existed. Didn't know if trust, once broken, could be rebuilt. Especially when the breaking had been so public, so potentially catastrophic.

Behind him, he heard footsteps. Knew without looking who it was.

"You followed me," he said, not turning around.

"Ruby said you'd be here." Ethan's voice was quiet, careful. "Can we talk?"

"Haven't we talked enough?"

"No." Ethan came to stand beside him, close enough that Caleb could feel his warmth but not close enough to touch. "We've argued. We've hurt each other. But we haven't actually talked."

Caleb kept his eyes on the river. "What's left to say?"

"Everything." Ethan's hand moved toward the railing, stopped just short of where Caleb's rested. "I need you to understand something. When I left twelve years ago, I was running from myself. From the fear that staying here meant losing who I was. That loving you meant giving up my dreams."

"I know."

"But you don't know why I really left." Ethan's voice was raw now, stripped of pretense. "It wasn't just about journalism school or career ambitions. It was because I was terrified that if I stayed, if I let myself love you the way I wanted to, I'd disappear. That Caleb Hawthorne's boyfriend would become my entire identity, and Ethan Cross would cease to exist."

Caleb finally looked at him. "And now?"

"Now I realize I had it backwards." Ethan met his gaze, eyes bright with unshed tears. "I didn't lose myself by loving you. I lost myself by leaving. Because you were always part of who I am. And running from that… it was like running from my own shadow."

The words hit Caleb somewhere deep. Somewhere that had been aching since the moment he'd read that headline.

"That's why I wrote the article," Ethan continued. "Not to expose you. Not to hurt you. But because I needed to understand what was happening here. To me. To us. To this town. And writing is how I make sense of the world."

"Even when it hurts people?"

"No." Ethan's voice was firm. "Never that. The article was supposed to help. To create understanding. To give people a framework for what they're experiencing so they wouldn't be afraid. But I screwed up. I saved it somewhere it could be found. I didn't protect it. And now—"

"Now my pack is exposed," Caleb finished.

"Yes." Ethan looked away. "And I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I don't know how to make this right."

"Maybe you can't." Caleb's voice was gentle despite the words. "Maybe some things can't be fixed with apologies and good intentions."

"Then what do we do?"

Caleb was quiet for a long moment, watching the river flow. Thinking about wards and ribbons and trust. About things that broke and things that held. About the difference between the two.

"We do what the Mayor said," he said finally. "We work together to calm the town. We give them answers that are true without exposing everything. And then…"

"Then?"

"Then we see what's left." Caleb finally looked at him. "If there's anything left to save."

—

Ruby found him two hours later at the tavern, stacking chairs in silence. The bar wouldn't open for another few hours, but Caleb needed something to do with his hands. Needed the familiar rhythm of work to quiet the wolf prowling beneath his skin.

She didn't say anything at first. Just grabbed a rag and started wiping down tables, working in companionable silence the way they'd done a hundred times before. Ruby had been his friend since childhood, had seen him through his father's death and Ethan's departure and every crisis in between. She knew when he needed words and when he needed quiet.

Today, apparently, was a quiet day.

But after fifteen minutes of stacking and wiping, she broke the silence.

"You okay?" she asked.

"No."

"Fair enough." She moved to the next table, her movements efficient and sure. "For what it's worth, I don't think he meant to hurt you."

"I know."

"But he did anyway."

"Yeah." Caleb set another chair down with more force than necessary, the legs scraping against the floor. "He did."

Ruby was quiet for a long moment, then set down her rag and came to lean against the bar. "You remember when we were kids and you first became Alpha?"

Caleb frowned. "That's a random topic change."

"Humor me."

"I was nineteen. Dad had just died. The pack was in chaos." Caleb's hands stilled on the chair. "What's your point?"

"My point is that you were terrified. But you did it anyway. You stepped up, took responsibility, held the pack together when everything was falling apart." She crossed her arms. "You know why?"

"Because I had to."

"No. Because you understood that being Alpha doesn't mean being perfect. It means being present. Being honest. Being willing to make mistakes and clean them up." Ruby's gaze was steady. "Ethan made a mistake. A big one. But he's trying to clean it up."

"It's not that simple."

"It never is." She smiled sadly. "But it's worth trying. Trust me."

Caleb looked at her. Really looked. Saw the understanding in her eyes, the empathy that came from her own experiences of loving and losing and learning to trust again. Ruby had been through her own heartbreaks, her own betrayals. And she'd come out the other side stronger.

"What if I can't forgive him?" Caleb asked quietly. "What if the damage is too deep?"

"Then you can't. And you'll both have to live with that." Ruby pushed off the bar, came to stand beside him. "But what if you can? What if this is just one of those mistakes that makes you stronger in the long run? What if walking away is the real tragedy?"

"You're very wise today."

"I ate a good breakfast." She bumped his shoulder with hers. "Also, I'm a hopeless romantic. I want you two to work it out because you're disgustingly cute together and I need something to believe in."

Despite everything, Caleb laughed. Brief and startled, but real. "Disgustingly cute?"

"The worst. This morning when you came in with coffee for him? With that little smile like you were bringing him the moon? I almost gagged. It was adorable."

"I hate you."

"No you don't." Ruby grinned. "You going to talk to him before the meeting?"

"I don't know."

"You should."

"Why?"

"Because you love him." She said it simply, like it was obvious. Like it was the only fact that mattered. "And because he loves you. And because this town is about to tear itself apart if you two don't figure out how to be on the same side."

Caleb didn't have an answer for that. Just stood in his empty tavern, surrounded by upside-down chairs and the smell of old wood and beer, and tried to figure out if love was enough. If it could bridge the gap between trust broken and trust rebuilt.

Through the window, he could see people moving past—heading to the co-op, the coffee shop, the town square. Going about their lives while the foundation of their community shifted beneath them. He could see Mrs. Chen locking up her shop early. Mr. Okoye talking to a cluster of neighbors, his hands gesturing emphatically. Even from here, Caleb could sense the tension. The fear.

His pack needed him. His town needed him. And he couldn't afford to be distracted by heartbreak.

But God, it hurt anyway.

Caleb stopped moving. "It's not that simple."

"It never is." Ruby pushed off the bar. "But it's worth trying. Trust me."

She left before he could respond, the door swinging shut behind her with a soft chime.

Caleb stood in the empty tavern, alone with his thoughts and the weight of responsibility that never quite left his shoulders. His phone sat on the bar where he'd left it, screen dark but buzzing periodically with messages he hadn't checked.

He picked it up. Scrolled through.

*—Alpha, what do we do?* (From Sara, one of the younger pack members.)
*—People are staring at me like I'm dangerous.* (From Marcus.)
*—We need to talk before tonight. Pack only.* (From David, his second.)
*—Is it true? Are we making people feel things?* (From Jamie, who'd just turned eighteen and was still learning control.)

And dozens more. Questions, fears, anger. His pack looking to him for answers he didn't have. For reassurance he wasn't sure he could give.

Caleb sighed, pulled up the pack group chat, and started typing.

*Emergency meeting tonight. 7pm. Town hall. Be there. We'll face this together.*

Then, after a pause, he added: *And yes, the Harvest Moon is affecting us. Affecting everyone. But we are not dangerous. We are not out of control. We are simply navigating something difficult, and we will do it with honesty and strength. Trust me.*

He hit send before he could second-guess himself.

The responses came immediately. Gratitude, relief, a few lingering questions. But underneath it all, trust. His pack still trusted him, even when he wasn't sure he trusted himself.

That had to be enough.

Caleb pocketed his phone, finished stacking the last few chairs, and tried to prepare himself for the meeting. For standing in front of his town and admitting that yes, the pack's emotions were bleeding into the general population. That the wards were weakening. That the Harvest Moon was making everything harder, more volatile, more intense.

And for working with Ethan to craft a message that would calm fears without exposing pack secrets that could be weaponized later.

He thought about the draft article. About the questions it raised and the fears it validated. About how Ethan had been trying to help, in his own way. Trying to create understanding through documentation, through careful investigation.

It was the same impulse that made Caleb maintain the wards, organize patrols, keep detailed records of pack dynamics. Different methods, same goal: protect the people you love by understanding what threatens them.

Maybe Ruby was right. Maybe this was just a mistake—a big one, but still just a mistake. Maybe forgiveness was possible.

But first, he had a town to save.

Caleb pulled out his phone one more time and sent a text to Ethan: *We need to talk. Before the meeting. My office, 5pm. Bring coffee.*

The response came almost immediately: *I'll be there.*

Three words. Simple and steady. Like a promise.

Caleb allowed himself a small, cautious hope. Not forgiveness, not yet. But the possibility of it. The willingness to try.

Outside, the sun climbed higher, casting sharp shadows across Maple Hollow. The town continued its nervous rhythm, people gathering in clusters, phones pressed to ears, worry etched in every face.

And somewhere in the distance, barely audible, another ward ribbon snapped loose and fluttered to the ground like a small white flag of surrender.

But this time, Caleb had a plan. This time, he wasn't facing it alone.

This time, maybe—just maybe—they could weather the storm together.

He locked the tavern door behind him and headed toward the sheriff's station to coordinate with his pack before the meeting. His phone buzzed again—probably more questions, more fears—but this time, he was ready to answer them.

Because that's what an Alpha did. Protected his pack, led his people, and held himself together even when everything inside him wanted to break.

And if he was very lucky, at the end of all this, he'd still have Ethan.

But first, they had to survive tonight.

The thought was steadying. Grounding. Caleb let it settle in his chest as he walked through town, nodding to the people he passed, meeting their worried gazes with calm reassurance.

Tonight would be hard. But they'd face it together.

All of them.

Including Ethan.

That had to be enough.

*For now*, the wolf whispered. *For now, it's enough.*

Caleb kept walking, jaw set, shoulders squared, and tried to believe it.
