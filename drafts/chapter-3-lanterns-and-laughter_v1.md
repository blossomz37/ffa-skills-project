# Chapter 3 – Lanterns and Laughter

The first lantern flickered on with a tiny gasp of flame, and the square exhaled like it had been holding the day for him.

Ethan stood at the edge of Harvest Square, digital recorder tucked in his jacket pocket, watching the transformation. The afternoon had given way to that peculiar autumn twilight where the world turned amber and gold, where shadows lengthened into something more than absence of light. Vendors finished setting up their booths—carved pumpkins arranged just so, bundles of dried corn stalks leaning against table legs, handmade quilts draped over wooden frames like flags claiming territory.

The air tasted like cinnamon and cold.

He'd been standing here for maybe ten minutes, cataloging details with the methodical attention of someone who needed professional distance to function. The way the volunteer coordinator—a woman in her sixties wearing a Maple Hollow Harvest Festival staff shirt—directed traffic with the confidence of a general deploying troops. The gaggle of teenagers stringing copper lights between lampposts, their laughter carrying across the square in bright bursts. The older couple arranging preserves on a table with the particular care of people who'd been doing this for decades.

It was all very picturesque. All very exactly what his editor wanted: small-town charm, supernatural undercurrents presented as quaint tradition, the kind of human-interest angle that made city readers feel wistful about communities they'd never actually want to live in.

Ethan pulled out his recorder, clicked it on. "October twenty-first, five-fifteen PM. Harvest Square. Festival setup in progress. Volunteers range from teens to elderlyâ€"multigenerational engagement. Atmosphere is..." He paused, searching for the right word. "Anticipatory. Like the town's been waiting for this all year."

Which, he supposed, it had. The Harvest Moon Festival was Maple Hollow's signature event—the week when tourists flooded in, when local businesses made enough revenue to sustain them through winter, when the supernatural community got to be openly magical without pretense or apology. It was celebration and economy and identity all wrapped into one.

It was also, increasingly, feeling like a trap he'd walked into willingly.

"Ethan Cole!" 

The voice cut through his observations like a spotlight. He looked up to find Mayor Vance approaching from the direction of the gazebo, clipboard in hand, flanked by two people Ethan didn't immediately recognize. She moved with the particular authority of someone who'd been managing this festival for longer than Ethan had been alive.

"Mayor," he said, tucking the recorder back into his pocket. "I was just—"

"Documenting our charming provincial rituals?" Her smile was knowing but not unkind. "Good. That's what we hired you for. Well, technically the *Gazette* hired you, but I approved the budget allocation, so I'm taking credit." She gestured to her companions. "This is Sarah Michaels—you remember Sarah? And Tom Brennan, our volunteer coordinator."

Sarah smiled, the same person he'd spoken with yesterday at the crafts booth. Tom was older, maybe mid-fifties, with the weathered look of someone who spent significant time outdoors. Both watched Ethan with the particular curiosity of people who'd heard stories and were now getting to verify them in person.

"We were just discussing the welcome ceremony logistics," Mayor Vance continued, her tone suggesting this was a done deal rather than a proposal. "You and Caleb will be co-hosting the opening remarks tomorrow evening. Nothing too formal—just a friendly welcome to visitors, some context about the festival's history, maybe a joke or two to set the tone. Think you can manage?"

Ethan's throat tightened. "Co-hosting with Caleb Hawthorne?"

"Alpha Hawthorne, technically, but yes." Mayor Vance's eyes gleamed with something that might have been amusement or strategy or both. "He handles the supernatural community welcome, you handle the human interest angle. It's a nice balance. Plus, you're both articulate, photogenic, and—according to Ruby—have 'excellent on-camera chemistry.'" She made air quotes around the last phrase.

"Ruby said that?"

"Ruby's been campaigning for this pairing since she heard you were coming back." Sarah's smile was gentle. "She thinks it'll be good for her podcast. Something about 'authentic hometown reunion energy.'"

Christ. His cousin was match-making via festival programming.

"I'm not sure that's—" Ethan started, but Mayor Vance cut him off with a gesture.

"It's already decided, dear. Caleb agreed this morning. You two will meet here tomorrow at four to review the script and do a quick run-through. The actual ceremony is at six, just as the sun's setting. Very atmospheric. The tourists love it." She consulted her clipboard. "You'll have about ten minutes total. Keep it warm, keep it welcoming, and for heaven's sake, try to smile. You look like you're attending a funeral."

"I'm just—processing," Ethan managed.

"Process faster." But her tone had softened. "Ethan, I know this is complicated. I know you and Caleb have history. But this festival matters to a lot of people, and you're both professional enough to put personal feelings aside for a ten-minute welcome speech. Yes?"

It wasn't really a question. Ethan nodded, feeling the weight of expectation settling across his shoulders like a familiar coat he'd forgotten he owned.

"Excellent." Mayor Vance made a notation on her clipboard. "Sarah, can you show Ethan where we're staging the sound equipment? I want him to test the microphone setup before tomorrow so there are no technical surprises."

Sarah stepped forward. "Follow me. It's over by the gazebo."

As they walked across the square, Ethan tried to re-center himself in professional observer mode. The festival was the story. The festival logistics, the community dynamics, the way supernatural and human cultures blended seamlessly here—that was what he was supposed to be documenting. Not his own anxiety about standing on a stage with Caleb Hawthorne while the entire town watched.

"You doing okay?" Sarah asked, her voice quiet enough that it wouldn't carry to anyone else.

"Fine," Ethan lied. "Just getting my bearings."

"Mm." She didn't challenge the lie directly, which he appreciated. "For what it's worth, Caleb's good at this kind of thing. He won't make it weird. He's been doing festival welcomes for years—he knows how to keep it light and professional."

"That's reassuring."

"Is it?" Sarah glanced at him sidelong. "Because you look like you're preparing for combat, not a welcome speech."

Ethan forced himself to unclench his jaw. "I'm just not used to being part of the story instead of reporting on it."

"Fair enough." They'd reached the gazebo, where a young man in his twenties was setting up sound equipment with the focused intensity of someone who took their job seriously. "Hey, Marcus! This is Ethan Cole—he's co-hosting tomorrow's welcome. Can you show him the mic setup?"

Marcus looked up, recognition flickering across his face. "Oh, hey! You're Ruby's cousin, right? She's been talking about you non-stop."

"That's me," Ethan confirmed, moving closer to examine the equipment. Professional ground. Technical details. This he could handle.

"Cool, cool." Marcus held up a wireless lavalier microphone. "So we're using these for the speakers—clips right onto your collar, transmits to the main system. You and Alpha Hawthorne will each have one. They're pretty intuitive, but I'll do a sound check with both of you tomorrow before the ceremony to make sure levels are good."

"Sounds straightforward."

"It is, mostly." Marcus wound the cable around his hand with practiced ease. "Only tricky part is remembering to turn it off if you need to have any private conversation. These things pick up everything within about six feet, and we've had some... memorable incidents with people forgetting that."

"Noted." Ethan filed that away under 'ways to avoid public humiliation.'

Sarah checked her phone. "I need to get back to the crafts booth—we're still setting up for tomorrow. Ethan, you good here?"

"Yeah, thanks."

As Sarah headed off, Ethan found himself genuinely examining the sound setup, asking Marcus technical questions about range and feedback issues, slipping into the comfortable role of journalist gathering information. It was easier than thinking about tomorrow. Easier than acknowledging the way his pulse had kicked up at the confirmation that he'd be sharing a microphone—sharing a stage, sharing space, sharing *air*—with Caleb.

By the time he'd exhausted Marcus's patience for audio engineering questions, the square had transformed. More lanterns had flickered to life, creating pools of amber warmth against the deepening twilight. The vendor booths had acquired their final decorations—corn stalks and pumpkins, wreaths and ribbons, the particular aesthetic of autumn made into architecture. Music drifted from somewhere, a fiddle tune that was both melancholy and inviting.

And there, across the square near the largest vendor setup, Caleb Hawthorne was directing a group of younger volunteers with the calm authority of someone who'd done this a hundred times.

Ethan's breath caught.

He'd known, intellectually, that he'd see Caleb eventually. Had prepared himself for the encounter the way one might prepare for a necessary medical procedure—with gritted teeth and deliberate breathing and the hope that it would be over quickly. But knowing and seeing were different things entirely.

Caleb looked... good. More than good. He'd filled out in the twelve years since Ethan had left, his frame carrying muscle that spoke to physical labor rather than gym vanity. His hair was longer than Ethan remembered, pulled back in a low tie that somehow made him look more himself rather than less. He wore jeans and a flannel shirt in deep green, sleeves rolled to his elbows, and when he gestured to demonstrate something to the volunteers, the motion was fluid and confident.

He looked like someone who'd grown into his authority. Someone who belonged exactly where he was.

Ethan stood frozen at the edge of the gazebo, watching. Professional distance had evaporated. He was just a man looking at another man across a town square at twilight, feeling the particular ache of twelve years compressed into a single moment of recognition.

Caleb must have sensed the attention—or maybe it was some Alpha instinct, some pack-awareness that Ethan couldn't begin to understand—because he looked up. Their eyes met across the distance.

For a heartbeat, neither of them moved.

Then Caleb's expression shifted—surprise giving way to something more controlled, more careful. He said something to the volunteers, gestured them toward their task, and started walking toward Ethan with deliberate, measured steps.

Fuck.

Ethan's hands went to his recorder, a nervous gesture that gave him something to do besides panic. He clicked it on, then realized that was absurd and clicked it off again. The device felt heavy in his pocket, like an anchor he could hold onto if the ground started shifting beneath his feet.

"Ethan Cole." Caleb's voice, when he reached speaking distance, was exactly as Ethan remembered: low and even, with that particular timbre that suggested both warmth and restraint. "Heard you were back in town."

"Caleb Hawthorne." Ethan managed to keep his voice steady through sheer force of will. "Heard you've been keeping the place running."

"Someone has to." A flicker of something—amusement? irony?—crossed Caleb's expression. "Mayor Vance says you're writing about the festival."

"That's the assignment."

"Professional interest in small-town supernatural integration, or just nostalgia?"

The question landed with more weight than its casual delivery suggested. Ethan found himself searching Caleb's expression for clues—was this mockery? Genuine curiosity? Some test he was failing by being here at all?

"Professional," Ethan said finally. "I'm here to document the festival. Nothing more complicated than that."

"Right." Caleb's gaze held his for another moment, then dropped to the recorder visible in Ethan's jacket pocket. "You planning to record our conversation?"

"No. I just—habit. I wasn't..." Ethan pulled the recorder out, showed Caleb the power indicator that confirmed it was off. "I'm not recording anything without permission."

"Appreciate that." Caleb's shoulders relaxed fractionally. "So. Mayor tells me we're doing the welcome ceremony together tomorrow."

"Apparently."

"You okay with that?"

The question was direct enough that Ethan didn't have room to deflect. He met Caleb's eyes again, seeing the genuine inquiry beneath the careful neutrality. "Are you?"

"I asked first."

Fair enough. Ethan took a breath, trying to find words that were honest without being revealing. "I'm here to do a job. If co-hosting the welcome ceremony is part of that job, I can be professional about it."

"That's not what I asked."

"It's the answer you're getting."

Something shifted in Caleb's expression—not quite a smile, but close. "Still deflecting with journalism speak. Some things don't change."

"Neither do Alphas who answer questions with more questions."

"Touché." This time the smile was real, brief but genuine, and it hit Ethan with the force of a physical blow. He'd forgotten what Caleb's smile looked like when it reached his eyes. Forgotten, or deliberately stopped remembering. "Alright. Professional it is. We meet here at four tomorrow to review the script. Mayor Vance has the talking points already drafted—we just need to divide them up and practice the transitions."

"Sounds straightforward."

"It should be. I've done this enough times to keep it simple." Caleb paused, his gaze drifting toward the vendors behind him. "The festival's grown since you left. More tourists, more structure. But the heart of it's the same—community celebration, harvest gratitude, the pack's acknowledgment of the moon's cycle. You'll probably recognize most of the traditions."

"I'm looking forward to seeing what's changed."

"And what hasn't?"

The question hung between them, loaded with implications Ethan wasn't ready to address. Before he could formulate a response, a commotion near the main vendor booth drew both their attention. Two of the volunteers—teenagers, from their appearance—were having what looked like an intense disagreement about booth placement.

Caleb sighed. "I should—"

"Go. Yeah." Ethan stepped back, giving him space. "I'll see you tomorrow."

"Four o'clock." Caleb held his gaze for another moment, something unreadable flickering in his expression. Then he turned and headed toward the teenagers with the kind of calm authority that suggested he handled this sort of thing daily.

Ethan watched him go, feeling oddly unmoored. The conversation had been professional, cordial even. No open wounds, no dramatic confrontations. Just two adults discussing festival logistics like reasonable people.

So why did his chest feel tight? Why did his hands still want to shake?

"Well, that looked painful."

Ethan turned to find Ruby approaching from the direction of the café, phone in hand and knowing smile on her face. She'd clearly been watching the entire interaction.

"Just coordinating about tomorrow," Ethan said, aiming for casual and probably missing by a mile.

"Uh-huh. That's why you look like you just survived a natural disaster."

"I don't—"

"You do." Ruby tucked her phone away, her expression shifting from teasing to something more sympathetic. "For what it's worth, he looked rattled too. Which is rare. Caleb's usually very..." She gestured vaguely. "Composed."

"He seemed composed to me."

"That's because you don't know what to look for anymore." Ruby linked her arm through his in a gesture that was both affectionate and proprietary. "Come on. Mom's making dinner early tonight because she's convinced you'll try to skip out if she gives you too much time to think about it. Also, the Hollow Choir is rehearsing at the gazebo in about ten minutes, and trust me, you want to witness that before you write about this town's quirks."

Ethan let himself be towed across the square, grateful for Ruby's chatterhis, for the distraction of her running commentary about vendor gossip and festival politics. But his attention kept drifting back to where Caleb was helping the teenagers resolve their disagreement, his hands gesturing with patient authority, his presence creating a kind of calm radius in the chaos of festival setup.

Professional. Tomorrow would be professional.

He repeated it to himself like a mantra, hoping repetition would make it true.

---

The Hollow Choir turned out to be exactly as advertised: six older residents of Maple Hollow who gathered weekly to rehearse "spooky carols" with varying degrees of competence and maximum enthusiasm. Ethan stood at a respectful distance, recorder running, documenting what could only be described as an enthusiastic assault on harmony.

"*...through the autumn leaves we wander, under moonlight bright and yonder...*"

The lyrics were original—probably—and the melody bore a passing resemblance to several different folk songs without committing to any of them. The singers themselves ranged from a tiny woman who couldn't have been more than five feet tall to a massive man with a beard that reached his chest. They wore matching scarves in orange and black, and their commitment to the performance was absolute.

"This is incredible," Ruby whispered beside him, filming on her phone. "They've been doing this for like twenty years. The song changes every year, but the enthusiasm remains constant."

"Are they aware that they're..." Ethan searched for a diplomatic word.

"Terrible? Oh, completely. That's part of the charm." Ruby grinned. "The festival wouldn't be the same without them. They perform this song at least five times during the week—opening ceremony, midnight bonfire, the kids' parade, the closing celebration, and usually one surprise performance that nobody asks for."

The tiny woman hit a note that could only be described as aspirational, and the massive man with the beard responded with a harmony that was somehow both flat and sharp simultaneously. Ethan found himself smiling despite his earlier tension.

"This is going in the article," he said, making a note on his phone. "This is exactly the kind of detail that makes a place real."

"Right? The *Gazette* loves them. They're basically town mascots." Ruby's attention drifted toward the vendor setup where Caleb was still managing logistics. "He does that a lot, you know. Caleb. The managing thing."

"That's what Alphas do."

"Yeah, but with him it's..." Ruby paused, searching for words. "It's like he doesn't know how to not be in charge. Even at family dinners, even at casual gatherings, he's always the one making sure everyone's okay, that everything's running smoothly. It's both impressive and kind of sad."

Ethan didn't know how to respond to that. Didn't know if he wanted to hear more about who Caleb had become in the years since they'd last spoken. The curiosity and the self-preservation instinct were battling in his chest, and neither was winning.

The Choir finished their song with a flourish, the final note held just long enough to become uncomfortable before collapsing into laughter and mutual congratulations. The massive man with the beard bellowed something about "next time we'll get it right," and the tiny woman patted his arm with the kind of fond exasperation that spoke to decades of friendship.

"Come on," Ruby said, tugging Ethan's arm again. "Dinner. Mom's probably already set the table three times and rearranged the centerpiece twice. She gets anxious when you're coming."

"Why would she be anxious?"

Ruby gave him a look that suggested the answer should be obvious. "Because you're her nephew who disappeared for twelve years and she loves you but doesn't know if you still feel like family? Just a guess."

The words landed harder than Ruby probably intended. Ethan had been so focused on his own complicated feelings about returning—about Caleb, about the town, about the particular weight of memories he'd spent years trying to forget—that he hadn't fully considered what his absence had meant to the people who'd stayed. To family who'd watched him leave and never quite understood why.

"I didn't mean to—" he started.

"I know." Ruby's expression softened. "You left because staying hurt too much. We get that. But coming back hurts too, in different ways. For everyone." She squeezed his arm. "So let's go have dinner with my mom, let her fuss over you, and maybe try to remember that you're allowed to belong here even if it's complicated."

Ethan nodded, throat tight. They walked away from the square as vendors continued their setup, as the Hollow Choir packed away their music stands and scarves, as Maple Hollow transformed itself into whatever it became after dark. Behind them, Caleb's voice carried across the square—directing, organizing, ensuring everything was exactly as it should be.

Professional tomorrow. Ethan could do professional.

But as Ruby led him toward her family's house, he couldn't quite silence the small voice suggesting that "professional" might not be enough. Not when the moon was building toward fullness. Not when Maple Hollow seemed determined to remind him of everything he'd left behind. Not when Caleb Hawthorne's presence felt like gravity itself, pulling at him in ways he'd spent twelve years learning to resist.

The square glowed behind them, lanterns multiplying in the darkness like small promises. Ethan didn't look back. Looking back had never been his strength.

Forward. The story. The festival. The professional distance that would keep him safe.

Tomorrow at four o'clock, he'd prove he could stand next to Caleb Hawthorne and feel nothing more complicated than collegial cooperation.

The lie tasted like cinnamon and cold air, and Ethan told it to himself all the way to his aunt's front door.

---

Dinner at Aunt Sophie's was exactly as overwhelming as Ethan had feared and somehow more comforting than he'd expected.

The house hadn't changed—same worn porch, same wind chimes that sang in three different tones, same ancient maple tree shading the front yard. Inside smelled like venison stew and fresh bread and something else, something that Ethan's memory labeled as *home* before his conscious mind could object.

"Ethan!" Aunt Sophie appeared from the kitchen, dish towel in hand, her expression doing complicated things between joy and restraint. She was older than he remembered—gray threading through her dark hair, lines around her eyes that hadn't been there before. But her smile was the same, warm and slightly worried, the smile that had welcomed him a hundred times when his own house had felt too empty after his mother died.

"Aunt Sophie." He found himself pulled into a hug before he could prepare for it, before he could armor himself against the particular comfort of being held by someone who'd known him since childhood. She smelled like bread dough and lavender soap, and something in Ethan's chest cracked open despite his best efforts.

"You're too thin," she said, pulling back to examine him with the critical eye of someone who believed food was love and insufficient eating was a personal failing. "But you're here. That's what matters. Come on, dinner's ready, and Ruby warned me you might try to escape, so I'm serving immediately."

Ruby, already seated at the dining table, grinned unrepentantly. "I know my cousin."

The table was set for three—simple white plates, mismatched silverware that Ethan recognized from childhood visits, a centerpiece of dried flowers and small gourds that was probably Ruby's work. The stew steamed in a large ceramic bowl, flanked by fresh bread and a salad that looked almost aggressively healthy.

"Sit, sit." Aunt Sophie gestured to the chair that had always been his during family dinners, the one that faced the window overlooking the backyard. "Ruby, pour the water. Ethan, tell me everything. Or nothing. Or whatever you're comfortable with. I'm not going to interrogate you."

"Mom's been practicing that speech for three days," Ruby said, filling glasses with practiced ease. "She's very proud of it."

"I just want him to feel welcome without pressure," Aunt Sophie said, settling into her own chair. "Is that so wrong?"

"It's perfect," Ethan said, and meant it. The normalcy of it—the gentle chaos of a family dinner, the easy banter between Ruby and her mother, the smell of home-cooked food—was doing something complicated to his defenses. Making it harder to maintain the careful distance he'd wrapped around himself like armor.

They ate, and talked, and Ethan found himself relaxing despite his best intentions. Aunt Sophie asked about his work in the city—safe questions, professional territory. Ruby interjected with stories about Maple Hollow changes, about neighbors who'd married or moved or had children, creating a narrative that placed Ethan back into the town's ongoing story.

"Old Mrs. Henderson retired last year," Ruby said around a mouthful of bread. "She was teaching at the elementary school for like forty years. Her replacement is this young guy from Vermont—super enthusiastic about integrated magical education. The kids love him."

"And the Castellanos opened a second restaurant," Aunt Sophie added. "You remember Marco? He's running the new place—focuses on human-shifter fusion cuisine. It's actually quite good."

The updates were gentle, informative without being overwhelming. Ethan realized they were trying to reintegrate him into the town's collective memory, to show him that Maple Hollow had continued evolving without him but hadn't forgotten him entirely.

"How's the festival piece coming?" Aunt Sophie asked, serving him a second helping of stew without asking if he wanted it. "Ruby says you're co-hosting the welcome ceremony with Caleb?"

There it was. The inevitable question.

"Mayor Vance volunteered us," Ethan said carefully. "We're meeting tomorrow to review the script."

"That'll be nice," Aunt Sophie said, her tone precisely neutral in a way that suggested she knew exactly how not-nice it would be. "Caleb's very good at those ceremonies. Very personable. He's become quite the community leader."

"So I've heard."

Ruby kicked him under the table—gentle but pointed. "You're allowed to talk about him, you know. We're not going to interrogate you about your history."

"Ruby," Aunt Sophie chided.

"What? We're all thinking it. Might as well acknowledge it." Ruby met Ethan's eyes directly. "You and Caleb were together. You broke up. It was messy. You left. He stayed. Now you're both back in the same town pretending you can be professional about it. There. I said it. Can we all breathe easier now?"

"Ruby Marie Cole—"

"It's fine," Ethan interrupted, surprising himself. "She's right. It's awkward. Everyone knows it's awkward. Pretending otherwise just makes it more awkward."

Aunt Sophie looked between them, then sighed. "Alright. Yes. It's awkward. You and Caleb have history, and now you're working together, and the whole town is watching to see how it plays out. Are you okay with that?"

"Do I have a choice?"

"You always have a choice," Aunt Sophie said gently. "You could leave again. Go back to the city, tell your editor the assignment isn't working out. Nobody would blame you."

The offer was genuine, Ethan could tell. Aunt Sophie wasn't trying to manipulate him or test him—she was simply stating a truth. He could leave. The door was always open. Maple Hollow wouldn't hold him if he decided staying was too hard.

But something in him resisted the easy out. Some stubborn part that had driven him to accept this assignment in the first place, despite knowing exactly how complicated it would be.

"I'm staying," he said firmly. "At least through the festival. I made a commitment to the story, and I'm going to see it through."

"Even if it's painful?" Ruby asked, her usual teasing tone replaced with genuine concern.

"Especially if it's painful." Ethan took a sip of water, gathering his thoughts. "I left twelve years ago because staying hurt too much. Maybe coming back and staying through the hurt is how I finally stop running."

The words surprised him as much as they seemed to surprise Ruby and Aunt Sophie. He hadn't planned to say them—hadn't even fully articulated the thought to himself until it came out of his mouth. But hearing it spoken made it real, made it a commitment he couldn't take back.

Aunt Sophie reached across the table and squeezed his hand. "Your father would be proud of you. He always said the hardest thing about being pack was learning to stay even when every instinct told you to run."

"Dad left though," Ethan pointed out. "He left the pack entirely when Mom died. Said he couldn't stand being around other shifters, couldn't handle the collective grief."

"He left the pack structure," Aunt Sophie corrected gently. "But he never left Maple Hollow. He stayed in the town, raised you here, remained part of the community even when he couldn't be part of the formal hierarchy. That's its own kind of courage."

Ethan had never thought about it that way. Had always interpreted his father's withdrawal from pack life as a kind of defeat, a failure to maintain connections. But maybe Aunt Sophie was right—maybe staying in a place that hurt, maintaining presence even when participation felt impossible, was its own form of strength.

They finished dinner with lighter conversation—Ruby's podcast ambitions, Aunt Sophie's garden plans for next spring, the particular chaos of festival week logistics. By the time Ethan helped clear the dishes, some of the tension in his shoulders had released. Not all of it—he wasn't sure all of it could release while he remained in Maple Hollow—but enough that breathing felt easier.

"You're welcome here anytime," Aunt Sophie said as he prepared to leave. "For dinner, for conversation, for sitting quietly while we watch bad television. You don't have to be alone in this."

"Thanks," Ethan managed, hugging her again—easier this time, less terrifying.

Ruby walked him out to his car, her hands shoved in her jacket pockets against the evening chill. The square was visible from here, lanterns still glowing like captured stars.

"You meant what you said, right?" Ruby asked as he unlocked his car. "About staying?"

"Yeah. I think I did."

"Good." She bumped his shoulder with hers, a gesture of affection and approval. "Because Maple Hollow missed you. And you might not believe this yet, but I think you missed it too."

Ethan didn't argue. He got in his car and drove the short distance to his temporary rental—a small apartment above the *Gazette* office that Ruby Alvarez had arranged for him. The space was basic but clean: a bed, a desk, a kitchenette that suggested cooking was optional. Through the window, he could see the square, could see the last volunteers packing up for the night.

He stood at the window for a long time, watching Maple Hollow settle into its evening routine. Somewhere in town, Caleb was probably doing the same—standing at a window or walking the perimeter, checking that everything was secure, that everyone was safe.

Tomorrow they'd stand on a stage together and welcome tourists to a festival that celebrated community, harmony, truth.

Ethan wasn't sure he believed in any of those things anymore.

But he was staying anyway. And maybe that was its own kind of truth.

The lanterns in the square flickered, and somewhere in the distance, a wolf howled—long and low and mournful. Or maybe it was welcoming. Ethan had forgotten how to tell the difference.

He pulled the curtains closed and tried not to think about how standing next to Caleb tomorrow would feel. Professional. He could be professional.

The lie tasted like cinnamon and old promises.

He told it to himself anyway, and tried to sleep.
