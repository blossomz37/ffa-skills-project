The ward stone was warm beneath Caleb's palm, as if the hill kept its own heartbeat to match his.

He stood at the eastern edge of the ridge trail, fingers pressed against the smooth river rock that had been set into the earth decades before his birth. The stone hummed with low-frequency magic—not the flashy kind that tourists came to see during festival week, but the old kind. The kind that lived in bones and roots and the slow turning of seasons. Ward magic that held boundaries not through force but through patient, constant presence.

Caleb let his eyes drift closed, feeling for the pulse beneath his palm. Steady. Strong. But louder than it should be—the magical frequency amplified by something he couldn't quite name. The Harvest Moon was still nine days away, but already he could feel its pull in the way the wards resonated, in the way his own wolf paced restlessly beneath his skin.

The ward stones worked through resonance, not containment. His mother had taught him that years ago, back when he was still learning to read the pack's emotional weather. The magic didn't trap or block—it harmonized. Found the frequency of the territory and hummed along with it, creating a kind of sympathetic vibration that let the pack know where safety ended and wildness began. Most nights, the wards sang a low, steady note. Barely perceptible unless you knew to listen for it.

Tonight they thrummed. Not dangerous, but insistent. Like the difference between a guitar string at rest and one still vibrating after the chord had ended.

Everything was louder this year. Mara had been right about that.

He'd been teaching younger pack members about the wards last month—showing them how to sense the boundaries, how to read the ribbons for strain, how to know when a stone needed reinforcement. One of the kids, barely sixteen and still uncomfortable in her own shifting skin, had asked why they bothered with the wards at all. Why not just let the forest be forest, let the boundaries stay unmarked?

Caleb had brought her here, to this exact stone, and pressed her palm against it. Waited until her eyes widened with understanding. *Feel that?* he'd said. *That's not keeping you in. That's keeping the wild from forgetting there are people down there who matter. That's how we remember we're both—animal and human, moon and daylight.*

She'd understood then. They all did, eventually.

He opened his eyes and surveyed the valley below. Maple Hollow spread out in darkness punctuated by amber points of light—porch lamps and street lights and the warm glow from windows where families were settling into their evening routines. From this height, the town looked fragile and perfect, like something that could be held in cupped hands. Something worth protecting.

The October night pressed close around him, damp and breathing. Mist threaded through the trees with patient intention, turning solid things soft-edged and uncertain. The air smelled of wet bark and turned earth, of cedar and the particular sweetness that came from maple leaves slowly surrendering to autumn. Somewhere in the forest behind him, an owl called—low and questioning. The sound carried through the darkness like a stone dropped in still water.

Caleb straightened, rolling his shoulders to ease tension that had been building since this afternoon. Since the moment Ruby had texted him that Ethan was in town. Since the confirmation of what he'd been sensing for weeks—that particular frequency in the air that his body recognized before his mind could name it.

He pulled his hand from the ward stone and started walking the trail, his boots finding the path through habit rather than sight. The ridge patrol was something he did most nights during festival season—a combination of practical security and personal meditation. The path wound through old growth forest for about two miles, connecting a series of ward points that formed a loose perimeter around Maple Hollow's northern boundary. Each stone needed checking, each charm ribbon inspecting for fraying or damage.

It was work that required attention without demanding thought. Work that let his mind settle into the rhythm of walking, breathing, being present in his body.

Tonight, that settling wasn't coming easily.

His wolf wanted to run. Wanted to shift and race down the hillside toward town, toward the scent that had threaded through the square earlier—cedar and rain and something uniquely Ethan that twelve years hadn't quite erased from Caleb's memory. The wanting was physical, insistent, the kind of pull that made his human skin feel too tight.

He breathed through it. Steady inhale, measured exhale. Alpha control wasn't about suppressing instinct—it was about choosing which instincts to follow and when. Right now, his pack needed him focused on the work of keeping boundaries secure. His own needs could wait.

The second ward point was fifty yards ahead, marked by a ribbon of copper silk tied to a low-hanging branch. Caleb approached it carefully, letting his senses extend before he reached for the physical marker. The magic here felt different—more volatile, with a sharp edge that suggested some kind of emotional bleed-through from the town below.

He examined the ribbon. The silk showed signs of strain—small tears along the weave where energy had pushed too hard against the containment. Not dangerous yet, but worth noting. During the full moon, when emotions ran highest and shifts came easier, a weakened ward could become a problem.

Caleb pulled a replacement ribbon from his jacket pocket—one of the ones Mara had prepared with her careful spellwork. The process of switching them out was simple: untie the old, secure the new, press his palm to the nearby ward stone to re-establish the connection. The magic settled immediately, the sharp edge smoothing into something more manageable.

He tucked the damaged ribbon into his other pocket to return to Mara later. She'd want to examine it, would probably use it to refine her predictions about how intense this particular Harvest Moon would be.

The forest around him was fully alive now, responding to his presence with the particular awareness that came from being in shifter territory. Caleb could sense other pack members moving through the night—not close enough to see, but present in the way the woods breathed around them. Sarah Chen running the southern perimeter in wolf form, her joy in the movement palpable even from this distance. Marcus and Tom doing a buddy check near the reservoir, their voices carrying faintly through the trees as comfortable conversation.

The pack was safe. The territory was secure. Everything exactly as it should be.

So why did Caleb's chest still feel tight with something unnamed?

Movement caught his attention—a fox darting across the trail ahead, its coat catching moonlight as it disappeared into the underbrush. The creature moved with the confidence of something that knew these woods intimately, that understood the boundaries between safe passage and territory not meant for crossing.

Caleb envied that certainty.

From town, a church bell tolled midnight. The sound traveled up the hillside, clear and sharp in the cold air. Festival time was beginning in earnest tomorrow—the official kickoff that would transform Maple Hollow from sleepy mountain town into something more permeable, more magical. The space between human and supernatural would blur, boundaries softening just enough to let wonder in.

And Ethan would be documenting all of it. Standing in the center of that transformation with his recorder and his careful journalist's eye, cataloging magic as if it were simply another human-interest story.

Except Ethan knew better. Had grown up knowing better. Had been part of this world before he'd chosen to leave it.

The trail continued, winding deeper into the forest. Here the trees grew close enough that their canopy blocked most of the sky, turning the path into a tunnel of shadow and filtered starlight. The temperature dropped several degrees. Caleb's breath became visible in small clouds that dissipated almost immediately.

His phone buzzed in his pocket—probably Jasper checking in from the tavern. Caleb ignored it. Right now, he needed the forest's quiet more than he needed connection to town. Needed the space to think without the constant low-grade management of other people's needs and expectations.

The third ward point was where things got complicated.

It sat at the edge of what used to be called Lover's Lookout—a natural outcropping of rock that provided a clear view of the valley and had served as a unofficial gathering place for teenagers with romantic aspirations for at least three generations. Caleb hadn't been here in years. Had actively avoided it, actually, for reasons that were becoming harder to ignore with each step closer.

The ward stone was embedded in the rock face itself, barely visible unless you knew where to look. Caleb placed his palm against it and immediately felt the surge—not magical amplification this time, but memory. His body remembering what his mind had tried to forget.

The outcropping itself had weathered since he'd last been here. The rock face showed new erosion patterns, small plants finding purchase in cracks that hadn't existed twelve years ago. But the shape of it remained familiar—the flat ledge wide enough for two people to sit comfortably, the natural curve of stone that created a backrest, the view that opened like a secret revealed.

*The first time: Ethan at fifteen, all gangly limbs and nervous laughter, following Caleb up the trail because some older kids had dared them both. The way Ethan's breath had caught when they'd reached the top, not from exertion but from seeing the whole valley spread below them like a promise. "This is ours?" he'd asked, and Caleb had understood he meant more than just the view. "Yeah," Caleb had said. "Ours."*

*Later, at seventeen: Ethan laughing at something Caleb had said, eyes bright with mischief and moonlight. The two of them sitting on this exact outcropping, shoulders pressed together for warmth, watching the town lights flicker below. By then they'd been coming here for years—to talk, to hide, to exist in the space between what they were and what they were becoming. Ethan's voice, soft and vulnerable in a way it rarely was: "You think we'll still be doing this in ten years? Just sitting here, being us?"*

*Caleb's response, equally soft: "I think I'll be sitting here in fifty years if you're next to me."*

*Ethan's hand finding his in the darkness between them. The way that touch had felt like promise, like future, like something solid enough to build a life on. The way Caleb had believed it, completely, with the certainty of someone too young to understand that wanting something didn't make it inevitable.*

*And then the last time, though neither of them had known it would be: Ethan at twenty-five, hollowed out by grief over his father's death, sitting exactly where he'd always sat but feeling like a stranger. The space between their shoulders suddenly impossible to cross. Caleb saying, "I need to stay. The pack needs—" and Ethan cutting him off with "I know what they need. I also know what I need." The silence that followed, heavy with everything they couldn't figure out how to say. The way Ethan had stood up first, turned away from the view, walked back down the trail without looking back.*

*Caleb had sat there alone for hours after, watching the lights below, understanding for the first time that love and duty could pull in opposite directions and there was no good way to choose between them.*

Caleb pulled his hand from the ward stone with more force than necessary. His heart was hammering, his breath short. The memories had come with full sensory weight—he could still feel the phantom warmth of Ethan's shoulder against his, could still smell the particular sweetness of teenage sweat and cedar, could still taste the grief of that final visit like ash on his tongue.

His wolf pressed forward, restless and aching. Wanting to run down the hillside, to find Ethan wherever he was sleeping tonight, to verify that he was real and present and not just ghost-memory made of moonlight and regret.

Caleb breathed through it. Counted to ten, then twenty. Let his pulse slow back to something approaching normal.

The ward here was fine. Strong, actually. Whatever emotional frequency was amplifying magic elsewhere hadn't touched this place. Maybe because no one came here anymore. Maybe because even the magic knew better than to disturb old ghosts.

Or maybe—and this thought surfaced unbidden—maybe the wards here were strong *because* of what had happened here. Maybe love, even lost love, even love that ended badly, was still a kind of protection. Still a way of saying *this matters, this place held something real, don't let it be forgotten.*

The idea made his chest ache worse.

He turned away from the outcropping and continued down the trail, deliberately not looking back.

The path descended gradually toward the river, following the natural contour of the hillside. The sound of running water grew louder as he walked—the creek that fed into Maple Hollow's main reservoir, running high from recent rain. The sound was soothing in its constancy, a rhythm that had been flowing here long before the town existed and would continue long after.

"Alpha."

Caleb's head snapped up. Nico Alvarez stood on the trail ahead, hands in his jacket pockets, expression calm but attentive. He must have approached while Caleb was lost in thought—not a great sign of Caleb's focus, but also not particularly surprising given the circumstances.

"Nico." Caleb closed the distance between them. "Everything okay?"

"Should be asking you that." Nico's voice carried the particular warmth that made him an excellent teacher and a trusted Beta. "You've been up here for ninety minutes. Jasper's starting to worry."

"Jasper worries professionally."

"True." Nico's smile was brief but genuine. "But also, you've been standing in front of that ward stone for fifteen minutes without moving. That's not exactly patrol behavior."

Had it been fifteen minutes? Caleb had lost track of time entirely, caught in the loop of memory and current reality colliding. He rubbed the back of his neck, feeling the tension that had settled there.

"Just checking the wards," he said. "Magic's running loud this year."

"Mm." Nico's tone suggested he heard what wasn't being said—that this wasn't just about magical frequency. "Ran into something interesting myself earlier. Pack of teenagers decided to test the boundaries near the old mill. Nothing dangerous, just teenage shit—seeing how close they could get to shifting without actually committing."

"Anyone I need to talk to?"

"Already handled it. Reminded them that the festival brings enough chaos without adding unauthorized shifts to the mix. They were appropriately chastened." Nico paused. "Also reminded them that being young and stupid is allowed, but being young and careless isn't."

It was exactly the kind of boundary-setting Caleb valued in his Beta. Firm enough to matter, gentle enough not to shame. Nico understood that leadership wasn't about dominance—it was about helping people find their own limits before those limits found them.

"Thanks," Caleb said, meaning it.

"Of course." Nico fell into step beside him as they continued toward the river. "You know what one of them said to me? Asked why they had to wait for the festival, why they couldn't just shift whenever they wanted. Said the wards made them feel trapped."

"What'd you tell them?"

"Told them about my first shift." Nico's voice took on a reflective quality. "How I was seventeen and thought I knew everything, thought the wolf would make me powerful and free. Did it alone, in the woods behind my house. No supervision, no pack around me to help if things went wrong."

"Nico—"

"It was bad, Cal. Really bad. Got lost in it for hours. Couldn't remember who I was, couldn't find my way back. If my uncle hadn't tracked me down, if he hadn't been there to guide me home..." Nico shook his head. "The freedom isn't in shifting whenever you want. It's in knowing you're safe enough to shift at all. That's what the pack gives us. That's what you give us."

They reached the footbridge, and Nico stopped, his expression thoughtful in the moonlight. "But here's what I didn't tell that kid, because they weren't ready to hear it: sometimes the thing that makes us safest is also the thing that makes us loneliest. When you're always the one holding boundaries, making sure everyone else is okay, you forget how to let yourself need something."

The words landed with uncomfortable accuracy.

"That's very philosophical for midnight," Caleb said, aiming for lightness and probably missing.

"That's very deflective for someone who's clearly struggling." Nico's grin took any sting out of the observation. "Come on. We've been friends long enough that you don't have to pretend with me."

They moved to the center of the bridge, the sound of water rushing beneath them creating a kind of privacy. Caleb's hands found the railing, needing something solid to hold.

"So. Heard Ethan Cole's back in town."

There it was. The question that had been hovering beneath every interaction since Ruby's text, since Mayor Vance's careful mentions, since the entire town had collectively decided that Caleb's personal life was public business.

"He's covering the festival for a feature piece," Caleb said, keeping his voice neutral. "Professional assignment. He'll be gone in a few weeks."

"That so?" Nico's tone was mild, but his eyes held knowing amusement. "And the fact that you two used to be together—that's not going to complicate things?"

"We're both adults. We can be professional."

"Didn't ask if you could be professional. Asked if it was going to complicate things." Nico glanced at him sidelong. "Those are different questions, Cal."

Caleb was quiet for a moment, watching moonlight pattern the water's surface. The bridge creaked softly beneath them, settling into their weight.

"You remember them together?" Nico asked, his voice gentler now. "I've only been in the pack eight years, so I missed it. But people talk. They say you two were—" He paused, searching for the right word. "—inevitable. Like it was written in the way you moved around each other."

"We were young," Caleb said. "We thought we could make it work."

"What happened?"

"Life. His father died. I took over as Alpha. He needed to leave, and I needed to stay. Neither of us was wrong, but we couldn't figure out how to not be wrong together."

"And now he's back."

"Now he's back," Caleb echoed.

Nico was quiet for a beat, then said: "You know what I learned when Elena and I first got together? After I'd been alone for so long, after I'd convinced myself that being Beta meant I didn't get to have that kind of life?"

"What?"

"That the pack doesn't need me to be alone to be effective. They need me to be whole." Nico turned to face him fully. "My daughter needs to see that her dad has a life beyond pack business. My students need to see that being shifter doesn't mean choosing between duty and happiness. And the pack needs to see their Beta as someone who actually believes the things he teaches—that community means supporting each other's joy, not just each other's burdens."

The words settled around them like snowfall—quiet but accumulating into something impossible to ignore.

"You okay?" Nico asked quietly.

The question was simple, genuine. No manipulation, no agenda. Just one friend checking in on another.

Caleb considered lying. Considered defaulting to the Alpha response—the one that assured everyone he was fine, that everything was under control, that whatever personal feelings he might have were secondary to pack stability.

Instead, he heard himself say: "I will be."

The admission surprised him almost as much as it seemed to surprise Nico.

"We're steady," Caleb continued, gesturing vaguely toward town. "Pack's strong. Festival prep is on schedule. The wards are holding." A beat. "Just... louder this year."

"The town or your heartbeat?" Nico's grin was gentle, taking any sting out of the observation.

Caleb huffed a laugh despite himself. "Both."

"Yeah." Nico leaned against the bridge railing, his own gaze following the water's movement. "For what it's worth, the pack's not worried about you and Ethan. If anything, they're rooting for you. You've been a good Alpha—probably the best we've had in decades. But you've also been alone the entire time. People notice that."

"Leadership requires focus."

"Leadership requires balance." Nico's tone shifted, becoming firmer. "You can't pour from an empty well, Cal. And you've been running on empty since before I joined the pack. Everyone sees it. We respect the hell out of your dedication, but we also..." He paused, searching for words. "We want you to be happy. Not just effective. Happy."

The sentiment landed with unexpected weight. Caleb had spent eight years assuming his role was to sacrifice personal wants for collective needs. That being Alpha meant being available, reliable, steady—not for himself, but for everyone else. The idea that the pack might actually want him to prioritize his own happiness felt almost revolutionary.

"I don't know if I know how to do that anymore," Caleb admitted quietly.

"Then maybe it's time to learn." Nico straightened. "Look, I'm not saying you need to rush into anything. And I'm definitely not going to join the town gossip machine speculating about you and Ethan. But I am saying—as your Beta and your friend—that you're allowed to want things. You're allowed to see if something that mattered twelve years ago still matters now."

"And if it does?"

"Then you deal with it honestly. Same way you deal with everything else." Nico clapped him on the shoulder. "Besides, you know what the pack's really excited about? The idea that their Alpha might finally understand what he's been teaching everyone else—that we're allowed to be whole people, not just our roles."

Caleb felt something in his chest loosen slightly at that. "When did you get so wise?"

"Around the same time I stopped pretending I had all the answers and started asking better questions." Nico grinned. "Come on. Let's finish the patrol. I'll walk with you."

They continued across the bridge together, the conversation shifting to lighter topics—Nico's daughter's upcoming school performance, plans for the mentorship circle he'd be running during festival week, Jasper's ongoing campaign to add karaoke Tuesdays to the tavern's regular schedule. Easy talk that required no particular depth of attention, that let Caleb's mind settle back into something approaching calm.

The final two ward points were routine—both secure, both holding their boundaries without strain. By the time they circled back toward town, the night had deepened into that particular hour where most sensible people were already asleep but the truly nocturnal were just beginning their activities.

"You good from here?" Nico asked as they reached the trailhead where it connected to the main road.

"Yeah. Thanks for the company."

"Anytime." Nico started toward his truck, then paused. "Cal? Whatever happens with Ethan, whatever you decide—the pack's got your back. We're steady because you made us steady. That doesn't change just because you might finally let yourself want something."

He drove off before Caleb could formulate a response, taillights disappearing into the mist.

Caleb stood at the trailhead for a long moment, listening to the forest settle around him. The patrol was complete. The wards were checked. The town was safe, at least for tonight.

He should head back to the tavern. Should check in with Jasper, handle any late-evening issues, review tomorrow's schedule. Should do all the things an Alpha does to maintain structure and stability.

Instead, he found himself looking toward the river footbridge, barely visible through the trees.

The bridge was public space—anyone could walk there. And it was technically still on his patrol route, even if he'd already checked that particular ward. If he happened to walk that way again, to stand in the middle of the bridge and breathe in the night air, that was just thoroughness. Professional diligence.

The rationalization was transparent even to himself.

Caleb walked back to the bridge anyway.

The wood creaked softly under his weight as he moved to the center point, his hands finding the railing again. The water below continued its endless conversation with itself, speaking in a language that predated words. Moonlight broke through the cloud cover, painting everything in shades of silver and shadow.

This was the bridge where he'd taught Ethan to skip stones. Where they'd stood together at seventeen, twenty, twenty-three—watching seasons change and pretending they'd always have more time.

*Ethan at nineteen, frustrated because his stones kept plunking instead of skipping. "It's in the wrist," Caleb had said, standing behind him, guiding his arm through the motion. "Feel the angle?" And Ethan had laughed, had leaned back into Caleb's chest and said, "Pretty sure you're just looking for an excuse to touch me." "Working, isn't it?" The stone had skipped four times. Ethan had turned in his arms, still laughing, and kissed him right there on the bridge in broad daylight. Not caring who saw. Not caring about anything except that moment.*

*At twenty-two, after Ethan's mother's funeral. They'd come here because Ethan couldn't stand being in his father's house, couldn't stand the weight of condolences and casseroles and everyone's careful kindness. They'd sat on the bridge with their feet dangling over the edge, not talking, just existing together in the grief. Caleb had counted the minutes between Ethan's breaths, had held his hand and felt helpless in the face of loss that couldn't be fixed with touch or time. "I'm still here," Caleb had said finally. "I know," Ethan had whispered. "That's the only thing that doesn't hurt."*

The bridge had witnessed every iteration of their relationship: friendship, something more, love that felt inevitable. And finally, the breaking—Ethan's father's death, the strain of expectation, Caleb choosing pack over partnership, Ethan choosing distance over staying.

*That last conversation, right here on this bridge. Ethan saying, "I can't stay in a place where every corner reminds me of what I've lost." Caleb saying, "I can't leave people who need me." Both of them right. Both of them wrong. The space between them suddenly uncrossable despite standing close enough to touch. Ethan had walked away first, and Caleb had let him, because he hadn't known how to do anything else.*

The wood still held those memories. The water still knew their names.

Caleb leaned against the railing, letting his weight settle into the bridge's familiar support. The wood was weathered now, softer than it had been twelve years ago. The town had replaced two of the planks last spring, and the new wood stood out pale against the darkened older boards. A visual reminder that time passed whether you paid attention or not, that things changed even when you wanted them to stay fixed.

His wolf was quieter now, appeased by the patrol and Nico's steady presence. But underneath that calm, something else stirred—not desire, exactly, though that was part of it. More like recognition. Like his body remembering what it meant to exist in proximity to someone who'd once made existence feel less like duty and more like choice.

He pulled out his phone, checking the time. Past midnight. The screen showed three texts from Jasper—the first asking if patrol was going okay, the second asking if Caleb needed company, the third just saying *take your time, we're good here*. Jasper, who understood without being told that some nights required more than the usual rounds.

Caleb typed back: *Heading in soon. Thanks.*

Too late to text Jasper more than that, though his friend would still be awake. Too early to start tomorrow's preparations. The dead space between day and night where nothing was required of him except his own company.

For once, that company felt almost unbearable.

A sound reached him from town—distant laughter, maybe from the late-night crew leaving the tavern. The festival transformed Maple Hollow into something more permeable, boundaries softening between day-life and night-life, human routines and supernatural rhythms. Soon the whole town would be operating on festival time—days bleeding into nights, celebration replacing schedule.

And Ethan would be there. Documenting it all. Standing close enough that Caleb would be able to sense him—cedar and rain and twelve years of absence compressed into festival week's forced proximity.

Tomorrow at four o'clock, they'd stand on the square's small stage and review the welcome ceremony script. Caleb would have to look at him in full daylight, would have to hear his voice without the buffer of memory or distance. Would have to pretend that his hands weren't itching to reach out, to verify that Ethan was solid and real and not just wishful thinking made manifest.

The thought should have felt threatening. Instead, it felt almost like relief.

What would it be like, he wondered, to stand that close to Ethan again? To smell him—not the ghost-scent carried on wind, but the real thing, warm and present. To hear his voice doing something as mundane as reading script notes. To watch his hands move, his expressions shift, all the small mannerisms that Caleb had catalogued over years and then spent more years trying to forget.

What would it be like to want something and, for once, not immediately calculate the cost to everyone else?

Nico's words echoed: *You're allowed to want things.*

But wanting was dangerous. Wanting led to vulnerability, and vulnerability led to the kind of hurt that Caleb wasn't sure he could survive twice. He'd spent eight years building himself into someone reliable, steady, un-needful. Someone who existed for others rather than for himself. The pack needed that version of him.

Except—the pack had just told him, through Nico, that maybe they didn't. That maybe they wanted him whole more than they wanted him untouchable.

The water rushed beneath him, patient and ceaseless. The moon moved behind cloud cover, dimming the light to something softer. Somewhere in the forest, an owl called again—questioning, waiting for an answer that might never come.

Caleb closed his eyes and let himself imagine, just for a moment, what it would be like to try. To stand next to Ethan tomorrow and not pretend he felt nothing. To let himself notice the pull, acknowledge the want, see if something that had mattered twelve years ago still mattered now.

The thought terrified him.

The thought felt almost like hope.

He opened his eyes. The bridge, the water, the forest—everything exactly as it had been. But something in him had shifted, some internal boundary relaxing just enough to let possibility in.

Tomorrow. He'd figure it out tomorrow.

Caleb pushed off the railing, his decision made without conscious thought. He'd go back to town. Check in with Jasper. Make sure the tavern had closed smoothly. Do all the responsible things an Alpha did.

But tomorrow—tomorrow he'd meet Ethan at the square to review the welcome ceremony script. Tomorrow he'd stand close enough to confirm whether the pull he felt was memory or something more present. Tomorrow he'd find out if professional distance was actually possible, or if his body had already decided for him.

And maybe—maybe he'd let himself find out what happened if he stopped choosing duty over desire, just once. Just to see.

The possibility sat in his chest like kindling waiting for spark.

He started walking back toward town, his steps steady on the familiar path. The forest around him was settling into true darkness now, the kind that came in the hours before dawn. But somewhere ahead, Maple Hollow's lights still burned—amber promises of warmth and human connection.

The temperature had dropped further, his breath now visible in consistent clouds. His jacket, worn and familiar, smelled faintly of woodsmoke from the tavern's fireplace. His boots knew this path so well they could have walked it without him. Everything was familiar, routine, exactly as it should be.

Except for the flutter of anticipation in his chest that had nothing to do with pack business or festival logistics, and everything to do with a man who'd once promised fifty years and left after twenty-five.

At the bridge's end, where the trail met the gravel road leading to town, a single lantern flickered to life. The flame inside shouldn't have been able to catch—there was no wind, no external source, nothing to explain its sudden illumination.

But there it was anyway. Glowing steadily in the darkness like a beacon, like permission, like the town itself whispering his name.

Caleb lifted his head, breath catching. Magic, or coincidence? In Maple Hollow, the line between the two had always been deliberately blurred.

He walked toward the light, and the forest behind him exhaled—satisfied, perhaps, or simply settling into the story that was already unfolding whether Caleb chose it or not.

The lantern burned steady all the way home.
