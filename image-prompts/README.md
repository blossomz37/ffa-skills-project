# Image Prompts

This folder contains model-agnostic prompts tailored for common AI image generators. Each file follows the same structure:

- Title
- Prompt: rich, descriptive content to generate the image
- Negative: elements to avoid
- Params: suggested aspect ratio, style modifiers, color palette, lighting, camera, composition, medium

Notes
- Keep prompts concise but specific; prioritize subject, mood, lighting, palette, composition.
- You can paste the Prompt line directly into your generator. The other sections help you tune results.
- Aspect ratios are suggestions (use the closest option your tool provides).
- All prompts align to the brand identity in `assets/branding-concepts.txt`.
