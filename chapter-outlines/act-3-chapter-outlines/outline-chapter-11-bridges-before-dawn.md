# Chapter 11 – Bridges Before Dawn

## Scene Outline 11 – The Distance Between

POV Character: Ethan Cole
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Maple Ridge Bridge and river path, pre-dawn mist; air crisp, water silver; town still sleeping.
Active Characters: Ethan; Ruby briefly; distant sighting of Caleb across river.
Passive Characters: None.
Tone/Mood: Regretful, tender, resolute.
Conflict/Tension: Ethan wrestles guilt for the leak vs his need for truth; decides how to make it right before the festival culmination.
Character Goal: Face the town and Caleb honestly—no deflection, no half-truths.
Emotional Arc: Shame → clarity → determination.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Ruby: “You taught me to tell the story that matters. Maybe now you just have to live it.”
	•	Ethan (to himself): “No more hiding behind quotes.”
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Use soft light and sound of running water as metaphor for truth and flow.
	•	Physical details replace internal lectures (his hand on cold railing, breath visible as promise).

## Plot Relevance

Plot A: Prepares Ethan to re-enter the festival publicly and reclaim trust.
Plot B: Shows found-family support (Ruby encouraging him to fight for connection).

## Structure

### Opening Hook
Mist hung over the river like unsent words.

### Scene Beats
	1.	Ethan walks bridge, sees damage from snapped ward ribbon.
	2.	Flash of Caleb silhouetted on opposite bank (checking wards) but neither crosses.
	3.	Ruby arrives with thermos and gentle pep-talk.
	4.	Ethan decides to speak publicly at the festival opening meeting.
	5.	Sun edges the ridge; the fog starts to thin—visual mirroring resolve.
### Closing Hook
He turns back toward town. Behind him, the river reflects first light—silver as forgiveness.

## Continuity Notes
	•	Time: Predawn following Chapter 10.
	•	Shift: Despair → purpose.
	•	Objects: Thermos, repaired ribbon.
	•	Promises: Ethan will address festival crowd.
	•	Information Revealed: Ward ribbons respond to emotional balance of town.
	•	Sensory Thread: Fog lifting = truth emerging.
