## Scene Outline 7 – Howl & Bean Morning

POV Character: Ethan Cole
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Howl & Bean Café, early morning; chatter, espresso steam, sunlight through fogged windows.
Active Characters: Ethan; Caleb; Ruby (hovering); Mara (brief cameo dropping pastries).
Passive Characters: Locals eavesdropping.
Tone/Mood: Playful, flirtatious, bright.
Conflict/Tension: Small-town attention amplifies every look; Ethan’s teasing becomes confession adjacent.
Character Goal: Keep conversation casual yet draw Caleb out for his article.
Emotional Arc: Light curiosity → mutual tease → undercurrent of genuine affection.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Caleb: “You asking for quotes or company?”
	•	Ethan: “Company makes better copy.”
	•	Ruby mutters: “Someone tell them this isn’t subtle.”
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Humor as affection.
	•	Strong visual cues: sunlight on fur collar, mug rings on wood.
	•	Keep it sensory—smell of espresso and maple, warmth on hands.

## Plot Relevance

Plot A: Builds open chemistry; public perception grows (“they’re cute together”).
Plot B: Sets gossip wheel turning; Ruby posts a “sweet candid” to her feed.

## Structure

### Opening Hook
Steam ghosted across the café window, and Ethan’s reflection smiled back at him like someone half in love with the morning.

### Scene Beats
	1.	Ethan waits, nervous; fiddles with recorder.
	2.	Caleb joins, calm; easy banter.
	3.	Light flirtation veiled as interview.
	4.	Ruby intervenes, teasing; Mara drops “love sachets.”
	5.	They exit laughing, more connected.
Closing Hook: Outside, Ethan touches his cheek; still warm from Caleb’s hand brushing crumb away.

Continuity Notes
	•	Time: Next morning.
	•	Shift: Teasing → real emotional pull.
	•	Objects: Recorder, pastry crumb.
	•	Promises: Meet later to “fact-check.”
	•	Sensory Thread: Coffee warmth + reflected light = awakening affection motif.
