# Chapter 6 – Late Shift Glow

## Scene Outline 6 – After the Applause

POV Character: Caleb Hawthorne
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Wildwood Tavern, after the opening night crowd drifts out; low music, amber lights, scent of cider and rain.
Active Characters: Caleb; Jasper (closing duties); Ethan drops in “for a quote.”
Passive Characters: None (empty tavern, closed sign turned).
Tone/Mood: Quietly charged, comfortable tension with gentle humor.
Conflict/Tension: Caleb wants normal conversation; Ethan’s presence stirs everything he’s been holding steady.
Character Goal: Keep interaction light but truthful—test whether their connection can exist outside festival duties.
Emotional Arc: Guarded ease → emotional spark → subtle surrender to affection.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Ethan jokes, “Your town’s dangerously charming.”
	•	Caleb: “It was charming before you started recording again.”
	•	They share a laugh; Jasper fakes a yawn and leaves.
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Use proximity and small tasks (stacking chairs, wiping tables) as intimacy language.
	•	Lean on tactile sensory anchors: warm wood, quiet laughter, faint brush of hands when they clear mugs.

## Plot Relevance

Plot A: Establishes off-duty connection; seeds physical comfort.
Plot B: Introduces small-town rumor catalyst—Ruby saw them leaving together.

## Structure

### Opening Hook
The tavern smelled like cinnamon and applause, the kind that lingered after everyone else had gone home.

### Scene Beats
	1.	Caleb and Jasper clean up; post-performance glow.
	2.	Ethan appears, feigning professionalism.
	3.	Banter and laughter; first moment of shared relaxation.
	4.	Jasper leaves—silence turns intimate.
	5.	They say goodnight too slowly; a brush of fingers on the door handle.
Closing Hook: Outside, the moon slips free of cloud; both look up from different sides of the door, smiling without reason.

Continuity Notes
	•	Time: Late same night as Ch. 5.
	•	Shift: Public ease → private warmth.
	•	Objects: Cleaning cloth (shared touch), empty mugs.
	•	Promises: Coffee tomorrow, “off the record.”
	•	Sensory Thread: Oak warmth + moonlight = safe attraction motif.
