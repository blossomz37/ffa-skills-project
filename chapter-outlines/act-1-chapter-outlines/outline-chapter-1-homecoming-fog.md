# Chapter 1 – Homecoming Fog

## Scene 1 Outline – The Return

POV Character: Ethan Cole
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Maple Hollow — late afternoon; October mist drifts through the valley. Main Street glows with jack-o-lanterns and early lanterns. Air smells of smoke, cider, and rain-wet leaves.
Active Characters: Ethan; Mayor Vance (welcome committee of one); Ruby Cole (energetic cousin recording a “homecoming podcast”).
Passive Characters: A few locals on porches; background figures at the Howl & Bean Café.
Tone/Mood: Wistful → playful → quietly hopeful.
Conflict/Tension: Ethan wants to appear unaffected by nostalgia, but memories and expectations tug at him. He’s hiding his nerves about seeing Caleb again.
Character Goal: Re-establish professional footing—deliver a calm, objective first impression while internally reeling.
Emotional Arc: Detached → overwhelmed → composed with a flicker of anticipation.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Mayor Vance: “Welcome home, city boy. We still remember your coffee order and your teenage rebellion.”
	•	Ruby teases him about the Harvest Moon legend—“They say anyone who runs from the Hollow always comes back when the Moon calls their name.”
	•	Ethan admits he’s here for a “short piece” but his tone betrays uncertainty.
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Lean on sensory atmosphere (fog, lights, scent).
	•	Show humor through awkward small talk.
	•	Keep Ethan’s interiority tactile: fidgeting with his recorder, noticing light on wet pavement.

## Plot Relevance

Plot A (Main Story): Establishes Ethan’s return, nostalgia, and professional motive; introduces Harvest Moon mystery.
Plot B (Subplots): Hints at found-family re-integration (Ruby, Mayor Vance) and the town’s affectionate meddling.

## Structure

### Opening Hook
Mist swallowed the last road sign before Maple Hollow—appropriate, Ethan thought, for a place that preferred its secrets blurred.

### Scene Beats
#! [EVENT] Arrival
	1. Ethan parks by the café, absorbing sensory details and emotional déjà vu.
	2.	Greeting — Mayor Vance ambushes him with warmth and sly teasing.
	3.	Ruby’s Interview — comedic, sets tone of cozy intrusion; introduces generational energy.
	4.	Moment Alone — Ethan gazes at the water tower’s wolf-shaped weathervane; heartbeat quickens at a familiar scent on the breeze (Caleb’s).
	5.	Decision Beat — He steadies himself: “It’s just a story.” He’s lying to himself, but it’s enough to move forward.

Closing Hook: From somewhere in the fog, a low, resonant howl answers the town’s church bell—half greeting, half warning. Ethan’s pulse skips. Welcome home.

Continuity Notes
	•	Time Elapsed: Morning travel → late afternoon arrival.
	•	Emotional Shift: Defensive to softened.
	•	Objects Introduced: Digital recorder, Ruby’s phone mic (for later leak subplot).
	•	Promises Made: Mayor Vance insists Ethan attend the festival kickoff tomorrow.
	•	Information Revealed: Harvest Moon Festival coincides with a rare lunar alignment; Caleb will chair the safety committee.
	•	Sensory Thread to Carry Forward: Fog + distant howl = Caleb’s unseen presence.
