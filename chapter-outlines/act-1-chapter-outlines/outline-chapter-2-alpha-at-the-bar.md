# Chapter 2 – Alpha at the Bar

## Scene Outline 2 – Last Light at Wildwood

POV Character: Caleb Hawthorne
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Wildwood Tavern, early evening; golden light, low music, scent of spiced whiskey and applewood smoke; porch lanterns halo the mist.
Active Characters: Caleb; Jasper Reed (bartender/mediator); Mara Linwood (apothecary/witch) drops by with “festival sachets.”
Passive Characters: A few regulars at corner tables; a pair of teen shifters playing darts.
Tone/Mood: Steady, watchful, quietly amused; undertow of longing.
Conflict/Tension: Caleb must keep the tavern calm and festival planning on track while tamping down his reaction to the news that Ethan is back.
Character Goal: Maintain equilibrium—at the bar, in the pack, and inside himself.
Emotional Arc: Controlled → unsettled → re-centered but aware.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Jasper (lightly): “Heard a city journalist’s back. Tall, curls, trouble?”
	•	Caleb (even): “We welcome visitors. We keep them safe.” (Beat) “Especially if they’re ours.”
	•	Mara delivers protective sachets for the festival. “Emotions will run hot this moon. Tell your people to breathe first, howl later.”
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Show leadership through small actions (fixing a wobbly stool, refilling water before asked).
	•	Humor is dry; longing is physical (fingers pause on a glass at the faintest hint of Ethan’s scent).
	•	Sensory: wood grain under palm, warmth of the bar lamps, distant howl syncing with heartbeat.

## Plot Relevance

Plot A: Establishes Caleb’s leadership, the tavern as community hub, and his internal conflict regarding Ethan.
Plot B: Introduces friendly meddling allies (Jasper/Mara); foreshadows emotional amplification this festival.

## Structure

### Opening Hook
Caleb polished the bar until the oak looked like poured honey and told himself the shine meant everything was under control.

### Scene Beats
	1.	Evening Rhythm: Caleb handles small frictions with quiet grace; packs up last delivery forms for festival security.
	2.	Mara’s Warning: She mentions the moon’s “hotter pull” this year; hands him sachets with a wink.
	3.	Jasper’s Tease: Casual mention of Ethan; Caleb’s calm cracks for half a second—eyes flick to the door.
	4.	Alpha Choice: Caleb reinforces boundaries for staff and patrons: “We slow down. We look out for each other.”
	5.	Private Moment: Alone in the doorway, he inhales the night air; the fog smells faintly of rain—and Ethan. He closes his eyes, then goes back to work.

Closing Hook: The tavern door chimes; for a flash he expects Ethan—only a delivery kid. Caleb’s smile is practiced, but his pulse hasn’t learned the trick.

Continuity Notes
	•	Time Elapsed: Early evening, same day as Chapter 1.
	•	Emotional Shift: Calm → micro-stutter → reinforced calm.
	•	Objects Introduced: Festival sachets; security clipboard.
	•	Promises Made: Caleb will oversee safety; Jasper offers to “accidentally” arrange overlaps with Ethan.
	•	Information Revealed: Moon expected to heighten emotions; Caleb’s “ours” comment signals old bond to insiders.
	•	Sensory Thread: Oak, smoke, and the after-scent of rain = Ethan’s proximity.
