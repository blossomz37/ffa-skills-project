# Chapter 3 – Lanterns and Laughter

## Scene Outline 3 – The Interview That Isn’t

POV Character: Ethan Cole
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Harvest Square at twilight; volunteers string lights; Hollow Choir rehearses “spooky carols”; air tastes like cinnamon and cold.
Active Characters: Ethan; Caleb; Mayor Vance (orchestrating); Ruby (recording B-roll); two Choir members.
Passive Characters: Vendors setting up; kids weaving between booths.
Tone/Mood: Playful, charged, slightly awkward.
Conflict/Tension: Ethan wants a clean, professional interview; Caleb answers like a diplomat, not an ex; subtext buzzes.
Character Goal: Get quotes and gauge festival angle without revealing he’s writing about the moon’s emotional effects.
Emotional Arc: Professional mask → disarmed humor → soft, unsettled hope.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Ethan (on recorder): “How would you describe the Harvest Moon to people who think it’s just pretty light?”
	•	Caleb (smiles): “Pretty light’s a start. It reminds us to be honest at least once a year.”
	•	Mayor Vance (breezing by): “Smile pretty, boys. The tourists like handsome cooperation.”
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Banter as intimacy; keep dialogue crisp with space for glances/pauses.
	•	Use sensory anchors (glow of lanterns reflected in their eyes; laughter sticking in the air).
	•	No big confessions; let subtext carry weight.

## Plot Relevance

Plot A: First direct interaction; plants theme of honesty; Ethan glimpses Caleb’s public vs private split.
Plot B: Ruby captures background audio that later matters; the Choir’s presence sets a playful community tone.

## Structure

### Opening Hook
The first lantern flickered on with a tiny gasp of flame, and the square exhaled like it had been holding the day for him.

### Scene Beats
	1.	Setup Montage: Ethan catalogues lights, scents, faces—reporter brain vs hometown heart.
	2.	Approach: He squares shoulders, hits record, greets Caleb with carefully neutral warmth.
	3.	Banter: Light joking about safety signage and Jasper’s tragic playlist; chemistry in the gaps.
	4.	Almost Personal: Ethan asks a question too close to memory; Caleb’s gaze warms then shutters, reverts to polite Alpha.
	5.	Interruption: Mayor Vance sweeps in; schedules them to co-host a brief welcome segment tomorrow. Both agree—too quickly.

Closing Hook: As Caleb steps away, his fingers brush the mic cord from Ethan’s jacket, gentle, unthinking. Static kisses Ethan’s skin; the recorder picks up his inhale.

Continuity Notes
	•	Time Elapsed: Next evening.
	•	Emotional Shift: Guarded → amused → a little undone.
	•	Objects Introduced: Recorder picks up incidental audio (to be referenced later).
	•	Promises Made: Co-hosting a welcome segment tomorrow.
	•	Information Revealed: Caleb’s public voice vs private softness; festival schedule ties them together.
	•	Sensory Thread: Lantern light + static touch = charged near-contact motif.
