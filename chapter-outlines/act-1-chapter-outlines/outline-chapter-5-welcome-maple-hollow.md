# Chapter 5 – Welcome, Maple Hollow

## Scene Outline 5 – The Stage and the Smile

POV Character: Ethan Cole
Tense: Third person past (Deep POV)
Setting: Harvest Square stage, late afternoon into early evening; bunting and lanterns; crowd buzz; cider steam rising in the cold.
Active Characters: Ethan; Caleb; Mayor Vance (MC); Ruby (side-stage with mic); Hollow Choir (background).
Passive Characters: Tourists, locals, vendors; Mara waving a bell at the back.
Tone/Mood: Bright, communal, flirtatious under the surface.
Conflict/Tension: Public performance with private history; both must keep it light while their chemistry hums on-mic.
Character Goal: Deliver the co-host welcome smoothly, prove to himself he can be here without falling apart—and without giving everything away.
Emotional Arc: Poised → warmed → rattled but exhilarated.
Key Dialogue/Reveals:
	•	Ethan (on mic, playful): “If you’re new to Maple Hollow, we measure time in cinnamon and moonlight.”
	•	Caleb (smile audible): “And we don’t let anyone celebrate alone.”
	•	Mayor Vance crowns their segment: “To honesty, harmony, and good pie. Preferably in that order.”
Style Guide Notes:
	•	Keep banter crisp, audience-friendly; weave in subtext through glances and small physical cues (handing off the mic, standing close).
	•	Use crowd energy and music to build a buoyant closing beat.
	•	Let a tiny slip—voice catch, lingering look—hint at deeper stakes.

## Plot Relevance

Plot A: Formalizes their collaboration; sets baseline of public chemistry and town investment in their rapport.
Plot B: Ruby’s recording captures spontaneous warmth; Choir starts a playful chant that becomes a running joke.

## Structure

### Opening Hook
Ethan’s breath fogged the edge of the mic, ghosting his first word across a hundred listening faces.

### Scene Beats
	1.	Pre-Show Jitters: Ruby fixes Ethan’s collar; Caleb arrives, steadying with one quiet joke.
	2.	On-Stage Flow: Their patter lands; crowd laughs; a child howls, the Choir answers.
	3.	Shared Look: A scripted line about the moon and truth hits too close; Ethan’s throat tightens; Caleb’s hand skims the mic cable—grounding.
	4.	Community Lift: Mayor Vance toasts; music swells; the square glows.
	5.	Step Off: Off-stage, they exchange a soft, sincere smile neither knows how to name.

Closing Hook: As the Choir starts a final chorus, a filament in a lantern above them flares bright—then steadies—like the town agreeing with whatever just sparked between them.

Continuity Notes
	•	Time Elapsed: Evening of the next day; closes Act 1 “Reconnection through familiarity.”
	•	Emotional Shift: Professional → playful ease → buoyant, quietly shaken.
	•	Objects Introduced: Stage mic (clean audio); mayoral toast bell; flared lantern as visual motif.
	•	Promises Made: Post-show debrief tomorrow; Ethan owes Caleb a coffee “for saving the intro.”
	•	Information Revealed: Town fully approves of their on-stage chemistry; public collaboration will continue.
	•	Sensory Thread: Crowd warmth + lantern flare = communal blessing motif.
